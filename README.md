mrds - Mark-Recapture Distance Sampling
=======================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DistanceDevelopment/mrds.svg?        branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DistanceDevelopment/mrds)

This package for R analyzes single or double observer distance sampling data for line or point sampling.  It is used in program [DISTANCE](http://http://distancesampling.org/) as one of the analysis engines. Supported double observer configurations include independent, trial and removal. All options in mrds are not yet fully supported via DISTANCE.

One can download a Windows package binary using the ["Releases" tab in github](https://github.com/DistanceDevelopment/mrds/releases). To install in R, from the R menu, use Packages\Install from Local Zip file and browse to location of downloaded zip.
