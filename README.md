mrds - Mark-Recapture Distance Sampling
=======================================

This package for R analyzes single or double observer distance sampling data for line or
point sampling.  It is used in program [DISTANCE](http://www.ruwpa.st-and.ac.uk/distance/) as one of the analysis engines. 
Supported double observer configurations include independent, trial and removal. All options in mrds are not yet fully supported via DISTANCE.
