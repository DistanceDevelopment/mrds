mrds 2.1.6
----------

BUG FIXES
 * some key+adjustment models failed to converge due to bugs in the optimisation code (mainly unif+cosine models)

NEW FEATURES
 * optimisation tips help page at ?"mrds-opt"


mrds 2.1.5
------------

CHANGES
 * models with both adjustment terms and covariates are now allowed
 * mono.check function checks that a detection function is monotonic over its range (at the observed covariate combinations if covariates are included)



mrds 2.1.4-5
------------

CHANGES

 * new testthat changes test locations etc, this has been sorted out.
 * which= argument in plot.* now sorts the which first, so plots will always be in order
 * plot.ds is now more friendly to par() users, thanks to Jason Roberts for the pointer

BUG FIXES

 * uniform+cosine detection functions were ignored when using monotonicity constraints, now they can be used together
 * mono.strict=TRUE didn't automatically turn on mono=TRUE, extra logic to correct this
 * montonicity constraints did not use standardised (g(x)/g(0) detection functions, so if g(x)>1 monotonicity constraints were voilated. Now standardised detection functions are used. Thanks to Len Thomas for noticing this bug.



mrds 2.1.4-3
------------

BUG FIX

 * predict.io.fi did not work for new data (thanks to Len Thomas and Phil Hammond for pointing this out)

CHANGES

 * general documentation updates
 * simplication and re-structuring of internals

mrds 2.1.4-3
------------
CHANGES

 * internal re-structuring of summary methods
 * more tests

mrds 2.1.4-2
------------
CHANGES

 * plot.ds now has a new argument, if TRUE (default) it will create a new window for each plot.
 * general janitorial work inside plotting methods, removing and simplifying old code; (hopefully) no new features.

mrds 2.1.4-1
------------
CHANGES

 * Warning now issued when truncation is set to the largest distance by default.
 
 * updated dht documentation


mrds 2.1.4
----------
CHANGES

* modified det.tables and plot.det.tables so it does not create and plot some tables depending on observer configuration (io,trial,removal).

* to plot functions (other than plot.ds) added argument subtitle=TRUE (default). It can be either TRUE, FALSE. If TRUE it shows sub-titles for plot type. If FALSE, no subtitles are shown. With this argument it is possible to get subtitles without main title. 

* set iterlimit=1 in call to rem.glm from ddf.rem.fi to prevent convergence issues in getting starting values. 

* created average.line.cond and it is now used in place of calcp.mrds which was computing average line for conditional detection function by weighting values by estimated population proportions for each covariate value. It is now weighted by sample proportions (mean value). 

mrds 2.1.3-1
----------
BUG FIXES

* patched dht.se so if vc1=NA it will not fail

* patched plot.ds to only issue dev.new when not using another graphics device so it plays nice with Distance.

mrds 2.1.3
----------
BUG FIXES

* patched bug in dht which was returning incorrect values in bysample for sample.area and Dhat.

* patched code in dht.se so it would skip over variance component for p when key=unif and p=1.

CHANGES

* modified code in detfct.fit.opt and io and rem functions to adapt to changes in optimx

* removed old depends statements to optimx and Rsolnp; uses import

mrds 2.1.2
------------
BUG FIXES

* fixed usage and example lines that were too long

mrds 2.1.1
------------
BUG FIXES

* for full independence methods, the calculation for the distance sampling component was for unbinned data only. Code has been added to compute this component correctly for binned data. This required changes to each of the ddf.x.fi routines and for the logistic integration routines.

CHANGES

* Modified flpt.lnl code to set integrals to 1E-25 if <=0 

* In integrate.pdf a vector argument for the integration range is converted to matrix if of length 2.

* ddf.gof will now use breaks set for binned data unless others are specified.


NEW FEATURES

* Added threshold detection functions ("th1" and "th2") which required some minor changes in other functions for summary/print.

* Added xlab and ylab arguments to plot functions to over-ride default labels

mrds 2.1.0
------------
CHANGES

* Modified DESCRIPTION so only R 2.15 or greater is allowed. Needed for optimHess jll(12/10/2012)

mrds 2.0.9
------------
NEW FEATURES

* New option plot=TRUE/FALSE in qqplot.ddf(), for when you only want the K-S and CvM test statistics, not plotting. dlm(11/13/2012)

BUG FIXES

* Fixed problem when obs dataframe in call to dht (which links observations to samples and regions) contained fields also in observation dataframe. Now only fields needed from obs are selected before merge. dlm(11/13/2012)

mrds 2.0.8
------------
* Unchanged version sent out with Distance in summer 2012

mrds 2.0.7
------------

NEW FEATURES

* Restructured likelihood/integration code for fitting ds models

* Adjustment functions will now work with binned data. Code was added to assure that fields distbegin and distend are available if binned=TRUE and breaks are set as well.

* Added argument adj.exp which if set to TRUE will use key*exp(adj) rather than key*adj to keep f(x)>0

* Added following restrictions for adjustments: if uniform key, adj.scale must be "width"; if non-uniform key and adj.scale="width", doeachint set to TRUE because scale integration will not work.

* Changed code in several functions so a uniform key with no adjustment functions could be used.

* New option plot=TRUE/FALSE in qqplot.ddf(), for when you only want the K-S and CvM test statistics, not plotting.

BUG FIXES

* Fixed inconsistencies in use and documentation of showit argument

* Fixed a bug where groups were not recognised in dht() when the size column occurred in both model data and observation table. (Thanks to Darren Kidney for spotting this.)


mrds 2.0.6
------------

NEW FEATURES

* Example code for binned point count data added to help for ddf

* Modified ddf.rem.fi and ddf.io.fi to use starting values from iterative offset glm to make optimization more robust

* Added a restriction so no one attempts fitting adjustment functions with covariates.

* Added some code to assure all of the necessary fields are available for binned data (binned=TRUE).


BUG FIXES

* Patched create.ddfobj so that point counts with binned data would work properly

* Patched ddf.ds such that stored data in object$data has detected=1

* Patched ddf.io.fi to throw an error when optimx() does not converge

* Patched ddf.io.fi and ddf.rem.fi so inclusion of factor(observer) will work in formula

* Patched dht, dht.se and covered.region.dht so it would handle 0 observations

* Suppress package messages from optimx

* Patched fpt.lnl, flt.lnl, print.ddf, model.description, summary.ds, print.summary.ds and coef.io, coef.trial, coef.rem, plot.io, plot.trial, and plot.rem to handle uniform key function.


mrds 2.0.5
------------

NEW FEATURES

* First version submitted to CRAN

BUG FIXES

* Fixed code in dht.se such that it uses sample size from detection model in Satterthwaite approximation rather than size of selected subset of observations.

* Fixed coef functions so they would return parameter estimates for adjustment functions if any.

mrds 2.0.4
------------

BUG FIXES

* Changed flt.var to compute variance of average p correctly for point transects.

* Numerous changes by dlm to optimization code

* Changes to documentation to remove non-ASCII characters

mrds 2.0.3
-----------

NEW FEATURES

* Major rewrite to ddf and summary functions to handle adjustment functions

BUG FIXES

* Changes to det.tables and gof functions to use include.lowest=TRUE in calls to cut function

* Changed all usage of T and F to TRUE and FALSE 


mrds 2.0.2
-----------

* For changes in 2.0.2 and earlier see ONEWS
