  abstract = {This paper describes a technique for computing approximate maximum pseudolikelihood estimates of the parameters of a spatial point process. The method is an extension of Berman \& Turner's (1992) device for maximizing the likelihoods of inhomogeneous spatial Poisson processes. For a very wide class of spatial point process models the likelihood is intractable, while the pseudolikelihood is known explicitly, except for the computation of an integral over the sampling region. Approximation of this integral by a finite sum in a special way yields an approximate pseudolikelihood which is formally equivalent to the (weighted) likelihood of a loglinear model with Poisson responses. This can be maximized using standard statistical software for generalized linear or additive models, provided the conditional intensity of the process takes an `exponential family' form. Using this approach a wide variety of spatial point process models of Gibbs type can be fitted rapidly, incorporating spatial trends, interaction between points, dependence on spatial covariates, and mark information.},

  abstract = {Effective strip width is a key parameter in estimating abundance and density from line- transect surveys. Here we estimate effective strip widths for 58 categories (genera, species, subspecies, stocks, or other groups) of cetaceans based on 13,500 sightings from 32 line-transect surveys conducted in the eastern Pacific Ocean by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center from 1991 to 2008. Generalized linear models (GLMs) are used to first identify factors that are important in determining the perpendicular sighting distances using stepwise model selection based on AIC. Six species groups of similar taxa are created and modeled separately. Important factors for most species groups include Beaufort sea state, swell height, visibility, group size, species, and a survey-specific categorical variable (Cruise\#). Interactions between species and the other factors generally do not improve GLM fits, indicating that the effects of those factors are relatively consistent for species within a species group. Factors selected for the best-fit GLMs are included as potential covariates in a line-transect model fit to a subset of the same data, again using stepwise model selection based on AIC. The best-fit line-transect models do not include Cruise\# and are generally simpler than the GLMs, likely because distant sightings were eliminated by truncation. Species-specific differences in ESW are seen within the species groups indicating that species of cetacean do differ in the distances at which they can be detected, even after accounting for the effects of group size and other covariates that affect sighting distances. Results from this analysis of multiple surveys can be used to improve estimates of effective strip widths for any survey using the same methods and similar vessels. This is especially true for seldom-seen species whose abundance is difficult to estimate from a single survey.},

  abstract = {Visual line-transect surveys are commonly used to estimate cetacean abundance. A key parameter in such studies is g(0), the probability of detecting an animal that is directly on the transect line. This is typically considered to be constant for a species across survey conditions. A method is developed to estimate the relative values of g(0) in different survey conditions (Beaufort state) by comparing Beaufort-specific density estimates. The approach is based on fitting generalized additive models, with the presence of a sighting on a survey segment as the dependent variable, Beaufort state as the key explanatory variable, and year, latitude, and longitude as nuisance variables to control for real differences in density over time and space. Values of relative g(0) are estimated for 20 cetacean taxa using 175,000 km of line-transect survey data from the eastern and central Pacific Ocean from 1986 to 2010. Results show that g(0) decreases as Beaufort state increases, even for visually conspicuous species. This effect is greatest for the least conspicuous species (rough-toothed dolphins, beaked whales, minke whales, and dwarf and pygmy sperm whales). Ignoring these large effects results in a nontrivial bias in cetacean abundance estimates.},

  abstract = {The distribution of wide-ranging cetacean species often cross national or jurisdictional boundaries, which creates challenges for monitoring populations and managing anthropogenic impacts, especially if data are only available for a portion of the species' range. Many species found off the U.S. West Coast are known to have continuous distributions into Mexican waters, with highly variable abundance within the U.S. portion of their range. This has contributed to annual variability in design-based abundance estimates from systematic shipboard surveys off the U.S. West Coast, particularly for the abundance of warm temperate species such as striped dolphin,               Stenella coeruleoalba               , which increases off California during warm-water conditions and decreases during cool-water conditions. Species distribution models (SDMs) can accurately describe shifts in cetacean distribution caused by changing environmental conditions, and are increasingly used for marine species management. However, until recently, data from waters off the Baja California peninsula, M\'exico, have not been available for modeling species ranges that span from Baja California to the U.S. West Coast. In this study, we combined data from 1992\textendash 2018 shipboard surveys to develop SDMs off the Pacific Coast of Baja California for ten taxonomically diverse cetaceans. We used a Generalized Additive Modeling framework to develop SDMs based on line-transect surveys and dynamic habitat variables from the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). Models were developed for ten species: long- and short-beaked common dolphins (               Delphinus delphis delphis and D. d. bairdii               ), Risso's dolphin (               Grampus griseus               ), Pacific white-sided dolphin (               Lagenorhynchus obliquidens               ), striped dolphin, common bottlenose dolphin (               Tursiops truncatus               ), sperm whale (               Physeter macrocephalus               ), blue whale (               Balaenoptera musculus               ), fin whale (               B. physalus               ), and humpback whale (               Megaptera novaeangliae               ). The SDMs provide the first fine-scale (approximately 9 x 9~km grid) estimates of average species density and abundance, including spatially-explicit measures of uncertainty, for waters off the Baja California peninsula. Results provide novel insights into cetacean ecology in this region as well as quantitative spatial data for the assessment and mitigation of anthropogenic impacts.},

  abstract = {Abundance estimation of hunted brown bear populations should occur on the same geographic scale as harvest data analyses for estimation of harvest rate. Estimated harvest rates are an important statistic for managing hunted bear populations. In Alaska, harvest data is collected over large geographic units, called Game Management Units (GMUs) and sub-GMUs. These sub GMUs often exceed 10,000 km2. In the spring of 2002, we conducted an aerial survey of GMU 9D (12,600 km2) and GMU 10 (4,070 km2) using distance sampling with mark-resight data. We used a mark-resight distance sampling method with a two-piece normal detection function to estimate brown bear abundance as 1,682.9 (SE = 174.29) and 316.9 (SE = 48.25) for GMU 9D and GMU 10, respectively. We used reported hunter harvest to estimate harvest rates of 4.35\% (SE = 0.45\%) and 3.06\% (SE = 0.47\%) for GMU 9D and GMU 10, respectively. Management objective for these units support sustained, high quality hunting opportunity which harvest data indicate are met with an annual harvest rate of approximately 5\textendash 6\% or less.},

  abstract = {Gaussian conditional autoregressions have been widely used in spatial statistics and Bayesian image analysis, where they are intended to describe interactions between random variables at fixed sites in Euclidean space. The main appeal of these distributions is in the Markovian interpretation of their full conditionals. Intrinsic autoregressions are limiting forms that retain the Markov property. Despite being improper, they can have advantages over the standard autoregressions, both conceptually and in practice. For example, they often avoid difficulties in parameter estimation, without apparent loss, or exhibit appealing invariances, as in texture analysis. However, on small arrays and in nonlattice applications, both forms of autoregression can lead to undesirable second-order characteristics, either in the variables themselves or in contrasts among them. This paper discusses standard and intrinsic autoregressions and describes how the problems that arise can be alleviated using Dempster's (1972) algorithm or an appropriate modification. The approach represents a partial synthesis of standard geostatistical and Gaussian Markov random field formulations. Some nonspatial applications are also mentioned.},

  abstract = {Simple methods to choose sensible starting values for the EM algorithm to get maximum likelihood parameter estimation in mixture models are compared. They are based on random initialization, using a classi\"ycation EM algorithm (CEM), a Stochastic EM algorithm (SEM) or previous short runs of EM itself. Those initializations are included in a search=run=select strategy which can be compounded by repeating the three steps. They are compared in the context of multivariate Gaussian mixtures on the basis of numerical experiments on both simulated and real data sets in a target number of iterations. The main conclusions of those numerical experiments are the following. The simple random initialization which is probably the most employed way of initiating EM is often outperformed by strategies using CEM, SEM or shorts runs of EM before running EM. Also, it appears that compounding is generally pro\"ytable since using a single run of EM can often lead to suboptimal solutions. Otherwise, none of the experimental strategies can be regarded as the best one and it is di cult to characterize situations where a particular strategy can be expected to outperform the other ones. However, the strategy initiating EM with short runs of EM can be recommended. This strategy, which as far as we know was not used before the present study, has some advantages. It is simple, performs well in a lot of situations presupposing no particular form of the mixture to be \"ytted to the data and seems little sensitive to noisy data. c 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

(1) Conceptually, IT encourages ecologists to perform tests on sets of straw-man models. (2) MMA improves on IT model comparison by implementing a simple form of shrinkage estimation (a way to make accurate predictions from a model with many parameters, by ``shrinking'' parameter estimates toward zero). However, newer approaches to shrinkage estimation are faster and have more rigorous statistical underpinnings. (3) It is likely that correct confidence intervals (CIs) for MMA (and other shrinkage estimates) are no narrower than those from the original (full) model. If researchers want to accurately estimate the strength of multiple competing ecological processes along with reliable confidence intervals, their best hope is to use full (maximal) statistical models after making principled, a priori decisions about which predictors to include.},

Because detecting animals from the air is imperfect, we develop a mark-recapture line-transect method using two digital cameras, possibly mounted on one aircraft, which cover the same area with a short time delay between them. Animal movement between the passage of the cameras introduces uncertainty in individual identity, so individual capture histories are unobservable and are treated as latent variables. We obtain the likelihood for mark-recapture line transects without capture histories by automatically enumerating all possibilities within segments of the transect that contain ambiguous identities, instead of attempting to decide identities in a prior step. We call this method `Latent Capture-history Enumeration' (LCE). We include an availability model for species that are periodically unavailable for detection, such as cetaceans that are undetectable while diving. External data are needed to estimate the availability cycle length, but not the mean availability rate, if the full availability model is employed.},

Accurate estimation of group sizes is essential for estimating the abundance and distribution of these species, but is challenging as individuals are highly mobile and only partially visible. We developed a Bayesian approach for estimating group sizes using wide-angle aerial photographic or video imagery. Our approach accounts for both availability and perception bias, including a new method (analogous to distance sampling) for estimating perception bias due to small image size in wide-angle images. We demonstrate our approach through an application to aerial survey data for an endangered population of beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) in Cook Inlet, Alaska. Our results strengthen understanding of variation in group size estimates and allow for probabilistic statements about the size of detected groups. Aerial surveys are a standard tool for estimating the abundance and distribution of various marine mammal species. The role of aerial photographic and video data in wildlife assessment is expected to increase substantially with the widespread uptake of unmanned aerial vehicle technology. Key aspects of our approach are relevant to group size estimation for a broad range of marine mammal, seabird, other waterfowl, and terrestrial ungulate species.},

Location: California Current Ecosystem, USA. Methods: Conventional spatial density models assume a constant relationship between densities and habitat covariates over some time period, typically a survey season. The estimated population size must change whenever total habitat availability changes. For highly mobile long-\-lived species, however, density\textendash habitat relationships likely adjust more rapidly than population size. We developed an integrated population-\- redistribution model based on a more ecologically plausible alternative hypothesis: (1) population size is effectively constant over each survey season; (2) if habitat availability changes, then the population redistributes itself following an ideal free distribution process. Thus, the estimated relationship between densities and habitat covariates adjusts rather than population size. We constructed Bayesian hierarchical models corresponding to the conventional and alternative hypotheses and applied them to distance sampling data for Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli), a highly mobile cetacean with distribution patterns closely tied to cool sea-\-surface temperatures.},

  abstract = {For biological populations that form aggregations (or clusters) of individuals, cluster size is an important parameter in linetransect abundance estimation and should be accurately measured. Cluster size in cetaceans has traditionally been represented as the total number of individuals in a group, but group size may be underestimated if group members are spatially diffuse. Groups of false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) can comprise numerous subgroups that are dispersed over tens of kilometers, leading to a spatial mismatch between a detected group and the theoretical framework of linetransect analysis. Three stocks of false killer whales are found within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone of the Hawaiian Islands (Hawaiian EEZ): an insular main Hawaiian Islands stock, a pelagic stock, and a Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) stock. A ship-based line-transect survey of the Hawaiian EEZ was conducted in the summer and fall of 2010, resulting in six systematic-effort visual sightings of pelagic (n = 5) and NWHI (n = 1) false killer whale groups. The maximum number and spatial extent of subgroups per sighting was 18 subgroups and 35 km, respectively. These sightings were combined with data from similar previous surveys and analyzed within the conventional line-transect estimation framework. The detection function, mean cluster size, and encounter rate were estimated separately to appropriately incorporate data collected using different methods. Unlike previous line-transect analyses of cetaceans, subgroups were treated as the analytical cluster instead of groups because subgroups better conform to the specifications of line-transect theory. Bootstrap values (n = 5,000) of the line-transect parameters were randomly combined to estimate the variance of stock-specific abundance estimates. Hawai'i pelagic and NWHI false killer whales were estimated to number 1,552 (CV = 0.66; 95\% CI = 479\textendash 5,030) and 552 (CV = 1.09; 95\% CI = 97\textendash 3,123) individuals, respectively. Subgroup structure is an important factor to consider in linetransect analyses of false killer whales and other species with complex grouping patterns.},

An updated estimate for the conversion factor from closing to `pseudo-passing' mode of R = 0.826 (CV = 0.089) is obtained. IO and `pseudo-passing' estimates are then combined using inverse-variance weighting to give estimates of 608,000 (CV = 0.130), 766,000 (CV = 0.091) and 268,000* (CV = 0.093) for the three circumpolar sets of cruises. These cruises have covered approximately 65\%, 81\% and 68\% of the ice-free area south of 60\textdegree S. As estimates of abundance for Southern Hemisphere minke whales, these are negatively biased because some areas inside the pack ice cannot be surveyed, not all whales migrate into the area south of 60\textdegree S, the assumption is made that all whales on the trackline are sighted, and minke whale sightings for which species identification is uncertain (`like minkes') are omitted. The three circumpolar estimates are extrapolated simply to account for the different areas covered in the sets of surveys, and also for the increasing proportion of `like-minke' sightings over time. The results suggest that for comparable areas the abundance estimates for the third circumpolar set of cruises are 55\% (closing mode only) and 45\% (IO mode only) of those for the second set, but that the first and second set estimates are within 15\% of each other. The decrease in abundance between the second and third sets is statistically significant at the 5\% level. Possible reasons for this estimated decline are discussed, related both to factors that might render the estimates non-comparable, and to population dynamics effects that could have led to a real decline. Further attention should be given, in particular, to the most appropriate method for estimation of mean school size for these surveys.},

  abstract = {Mark-recapture (MR) methods are commonly used to study wildlife populations. Taking advantage of modern genetics one can generalize from ``recapture of self'' to ``recapture of closely-related kin''. Abundance and other demographic parameters of adults can then be estimated using, if necessary, only samples from dead animals (liverelease is optional). This greatly widens the scope of MR, e.g. to commercial fisheries where large-scale tagging is impractical, and enhances the power of conventional MR studies where live release and tissue sampling is possible. We give explicit formulae for kinship (i.e. recapture) probabilities in general and specific cases. These yield a pseudo likelihood based on pairwise comparisons of individuals in the sample. It is shown that the pseudo likelihood approximates the full likelihood under sparse sampling of large populations. Experimental design is addressed via the principle of maximizing the Fisher information for parameters of interest. Finally, we discuss challenges related to kinship determination from genetic data, focusing on current limitations and future possibilities.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Spatially explicit estimates of population density, together with appropriate estimates of uncertainty, are required in many management contexts. Density surface models (DSMs) are a two-stage approach for estimating spatially varying density from distance sampling data. First, detection probabilities\textemdash perhaps depending on covariates\textemdash are estimated based on details of individual encounters; next, local densities are estimated using a GAM, by fitting local encounter rates to location and/or spatially varying covariates while allowing for the estimated detectabilities. One criticism of DSMs has been that uncertainty from the two stages is not usually propagated correctly into the final variance estimates. We show how to reformulate a DSM so that the uncertainty in detection probability from the distance sampling stage (regardless of its complexity) is captured as an extra random effect in the GAM stage. In effect, we refit an approximation to the detection function model at the same time as fitting the spatial model. This allows straightforward computation of the overall variance via exactly the same software already needed to fit the GAM. A further extension allows for spatial variation in group size, which can be an important covariate for detectability as well as directly affecting abundance. We illustrate these models using point transect survey data of Island Scrub-Jays on Santa Cruz Island, CA, and harbour porpoise from the SCANS-II line transect survey of European waters.

The increasing popularity of Bayesian methods for these and other model classes is mainly caused by the introduction of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation techniques which allow realistic modeling of complex problems. This paper describes the capabilities of the free software package BayesX for estimating regression models with structured additive predictor based on MCMC inference. The program extends the capabilities of existing software for semiparametric regression included in S-PLUS, SAS, R or Stata. Many model classes well known from the literature are special cases of the models supported by BayesX. Examples are generalized additive (mixed) models, dynamic models, varying coefficient models, geoadditive models, geographically weighted regression and models for space-time regression. BayesX supports the most common distributions for the response variable. For univariate responses these are Gaussian, Binomial, Poisson, Gamma, negative Binomial, zero inflated Poisson and zero inflated negative binomial. For multicategorical responses, both multinomial logit and probit models for unordered categories of the response as well as cumulative threshold models for ordered categories can be estimated. Moreover, BayesX allows the estimation of complex continuous time survival and hazard rate models.},

Analyzing all possible data subsets of a certain size is computationally prohibitive, so we provide a finite-sample metric to approximately compute the number (or fraction) of observations that has the greatest influence on a given result when dropped. We call our resulting metric the Approximate Maximum Influence Perturbation. Our approximation is automatically computable and works for common estimators (including OLS, IV, GMM, MLE, and variational Bayes). We provide explicit finite-sample error bounds on our approximation for linear and instrumental variables regressions. At minimal computational cost, our metric provides an exact finite-sample lower bound on sensitivity for any estimator, so any non-robustness our metric finds is conclusive. We demonstrate that the Approximate Maximum Influence Perturbation is driven by a low signal-to-noise ratio in the inference problem, is not reflected in standard errors, does not disappear asymptotically, and is not a product of misspecification. Several empirical applications show that even 2-parameter linear regression analyses of randomized trials can be highly sensitive. While we find some applications are robust, in others the sign of a treatment effect can be changed by dropping less than 1\% of the sample even when standard errors are small.},

A total of 1,932 linear kilometers was surveyed along 33 transects. In addition to using observers, the aircraft was equipped with two oblique cameras to capture a comparable data set. Analysts reviewed the images for narwhal sightings, which were then matched to the observer sightings. The objectives of the study were to determine advantages and disadvantages of the detection capabilities of both methodologies, and to conduct a comparative analysis of population abundance estimates. Correcting for the truncated detection distance of the images (500 m), the image analysts recorded more sightings (62) and a lower mean group size (2.2) compared to aerial observers (36 and 3.5, respectively), resulting in comparable numbers of individuals detected by both platforms (135 vs. 126). The abundance estimate based on the image sightings was 2,536 (CV = 0.51, 95\% CI: 1,003\textendash 6,406), which was not significantly different from the aerial observers estimate of 2,596 individuals (CV = 0.51; 95\% CI: 961\textendash 7,008).

  abstract = {Double-observer line transect methods are becoming increasingly widespread, especially for the estimation of marine mammal abundance from aerial and shipboard surveys when detection of animals on the line is uncertain. The resulting data supplement conventional distance sampling data with two-sample mark\textendash recapture data. Like conventional mark\textendash recapture data, these have inherent problems for estimating abundance in the presence of heterogeneity. Unlike conventional mark\textendash recapture methods, line transect methods use knowledge of the distribution of a covariate, which affects detection probability (namely, distance from the transect line) in inference. This knowledge can be used to diagnose unmodeled heterogeneity in the mark\textendash recapture component of the data. By modeling the covariance in detection probabilities with distance, we show how the estimation problem can be formulated in terms of different levels of independence. At one extreme, full independence is assumed, as in the Petersen estimator (which does not use distance data); at the other extreme, independence only occurs in the limit as detection probability tends to one. Between the two extremes, there is a range of models, including those currently in common use, which have intermediate levels of independence. We show how this framework can be used to provide more reliable analysis of double-observer line transect data. We test the methods by simulation, and by analysis of a dataset for which true abundance is known. We illustrate the approach through analysis of minke whale sightings data from the North Sea and adjacent waters.},

Effective conservation will depend critically on our understanding of the relationship between the species and its habitats. The Albor\'an Sea is believed to be the most important remaining Mediterranean habitat for this species, and thus constitutes a vital source of information for the development of conservation measures. We used spatial modelling to estimate the abundance and explore the habitat use of common dolphins in this area, examining regional, seasonal and interannual variations, as well as the influence of biological factors such as presence of calves, interspecific relationships and behaviour. From 1992 to 2004, 37 385 km of non-systematic line transects generated 738 sightings in a 19 189 km2 study area. The point estimate of abundance was 19 428 (95\% CI = 15 277 to 22 804) dolphins. Seasonal and geographical variations in abundance were detected, with higher average density in summer than in winter, and in the Western Albor\'an Sea than in the east Gulf of Vera, which has different physical/environmental characteristics. No overall trend in abundance was observed in the Albor\'an area. However, a decline was observed in the Gulf of Vera, with a summer density 3-fold lower in the period from 1996 to 2004 than in 1992 to 1995. A potential link of this decline with prey depletion due to the exponential growth of aquaculture in the area is discussed. Clear differences in habitat use were also found when examining the influence of biological factors. In particular, groups with calves and groups that were feeding preferred more coastal waters. This result could have important implications for the development of conservation measures for this species in the Mediterranean.},

  abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

  abstract = {Recently-developed spatial capture-recapture (SCR) methods represent a major advance over traditional capture-capture methods because they yield explicit estimates of animal density instead of population size within an unknown area, and they account for heterogeneity in capture probability arising from the juxtaposition of individuals and sample locations. Although the utility of SCR methods is gaining recognition, the requirement that all individuals can be uniquely identified excludes their use in many contexts. In this paper, we develop models for situations in which individual recognition is not possible, thereby allowing SCR methods to be applied in studies of unmarked or partially-marked populations. The data required for our model are spatially-referenced counts made on one or more sample occasions at a collection of closely-spaced sample units such that individuals can be encountered at multiple locations. Our approach utilizes the spatial correlation in counts as information about the location of individual activity centers, which enables estimation of density and distance-related heterogeneity in detection. Cameratraps, hair snares, track plates, sound recordings, and even point counts can yield spatially-correlated count data, and thus our model is widely applicable. A simulation study demonstrated that while the posterior distribution of abundance or density is strongly skewed in small samples, the posterior mode is an accurate point estimator as long as the trap spacing is not too large relative to scale parameter ({$\sigma$}) of the detection function. Marking a subset of the population can lead to substantial reductions in posterior skew and increased posterior precision. We also fit the model to point count data collected on the northern parula (Parula americana), and obtained a density estimate (posterior mode) of 0.38 (95\% CI: 0.19, 1.64) birds/ha. Our paper challenges sampling and analytical conventions by demonstrating that neither spatial independence nor individual recognition is needed to estimate population density \textemdash{} rather, spatial dependence induced by design can be informative about individual distribution and density.},

Here we present a simple analytic argument that NNs are in fact essentially polynomial regression models. This view will have various implications for NNs, e.g. providing an explanation for why convergence problems arise in NNs, and it gives rough guidance on avoiding overfitting. In addition, we use this phenomenon to predict and confirm a multicollinearity property of NNs not previously reported in the literature. Most importantly, given this loose correspondence, one may choose to routinely use polynomial models instead of NNs, thus avoiding some major problems of the latter, such as having to set many tuning parameters and dealing with convergence issues. We present a number of empirical results; in each case, the accuracy of the polynomial approach matches or exceeds that of NN approaches. A many-featured, open-source software package, polyreg, is available.},

  abstract = {There is growing interest from research and conservation groups in the potential for using small unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs; {$<$}2 kg) to conduct wildlife surveys because they are affordable, easy to use, readily available and reliable. However, limitations such as short flight endurance, and in many situations, aviation regulations, have constrained the use of small UAVs in survey applications. Thus, there is a need to refine survey methods adapted to small UAVs that conform to standard operations within aviation law. We developed a novel survey approach based on a grid sampling design using two multirotor UAVs (Phantom 4 Pros) flying simultaneously, within visual line of sight, from our vessel base-station. We used this approach to assess the finescale distribution and abundance of dugongs (Dugong dugon) in the remote waters of the Pilbara, Western Australia during three field seasons across 2 years. We surveyed 64 non-overlapping survey cells in random order one or more times and obtained complete image coverage of each surveyed cell of our 31 km2 survey area. Our sampling design maximizes sampling effort while limiting survey time by surveying four cells, two at a time, from one location. Overall, we conducted 240 flights with up to 17 flights per day (mean = 14 flights per day) and could obtain complete coverage of up to 11.36 km2per day. A total of 149 dugongs were sighted within the 50,482 images which we manually reviewed. Spatially-explicit models of dugong density distribution (corrected for availability and perception bias) were produced using general additive models to identify areas more or less used by dugongs (range of corrected dugong densities across all field season = 0.002\textendash 1.79 dugongs per 0.04 km2). Dugong abundance estimates ranged from 47 individuals in June 2019 (CV = 0.17) to 103 individuals in May 2018 (CV = 0.36). Our method, which proved convincing in a real-word application by its feasibility, ease of implementation, and achievable surface coverage has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications from community-based local-scale surveys, to long-term repeated/intensive surveys, and impact assessments and environmental monitoring studies.},

  abstract = {Ecologists often use transect surveys to estimate the density and abundance of animal populations. Errors in species classification are often evident in such surveys, yet few statistical methods exist to properly account for them. In this paper, we examine biases that result from species misidentification when ignored, and we develop statistical models to provide unbiased estimates of density in the face of such errors. Our approach treats true species identity as a latent variable and requires auxiliary information on the misclassification process (such as informative priors, experiments using known species, or a double-observer protocol). We illustrate our approach with simulated census data and with double-observer survey data for ice-associated seals in the Bering Sea. For the seal analysis, we integrated misclassification into a model-based framework for distance-sampling data. The simulated data analysis demonstrated reliable estimation of animal density when there are experimental data to inform misclassification rates; double-observer protocols provided robust inference when there were "unknown" species observations but no outright misclassification, or when misclassification probabilities were symmetric and a symmetry constraint was imposed during estimation. Under our modeling framework, we obtained reasonable apparent densities of seal species even under considerable imprecision in species identification. We obtained more reliable inferences when modeling variation in density among transects. We argue that ecologists should often use spatially explicit models to account for differences in species distributions when trying to account for species misidentification. Our results support using double-observer sampling protocols that guard against species misclassification (i.e., by recording uncertain observations as "unknown").},

  abstract = {Polar bears are of international conservation concern due to climate change but are difficult to study because of low densities and an expansive, circumpolar distribution. In a collaborative U.S.-Russian effort in spring of 2016, we used aerial surveys to detect and estimate the abundance of polar bears on sea ice in the Chukchi Sea. Our surveys used a combination of thermal imagery, digital photography, and human observations. Using spatio-temporal statistical models that related bear and track densities to physiographic and biological covariates (e.g., sea ice extent, resource selection functions derived from satellite tags), we predicted abundance and spatial distribution throughout our study area. Estimates of 2016 abundance (                                                                                                                                           N                         \^                                              *                                                                                       ) ranged from 3,435 (95\% CI: 2,300-5,131) to 5,444 (95\% CI: 3,636-8,152) depending on the proportion of bears assumed to be missed on the transect line during Russian surveys (               g               (0)). Our point estimates are larger than, but of similar magnitude to, a recent estimate for the period 2008-2016 (                                                                                                                                                                      N                           \^                                                  *                                              =                       2                       ,                       937                                                                                       ; 95\% CI 1,522-5,944) derived from an integrated population model applied to a slightly smaller area. Although a number of factors (e.g., equipment issues, differing platforms, low sample sizes, size of the study area relative to sampling effort) required us to make a number of assumptions to generate estimates, it establishes a useful lower bound for abundance, and suggests high spring polar bear densities on sea ice in Russian waters south of Wrangell Island. With future improvements, we suggest that springtime aerial surveys may represent a plausible avenue for studying abundance and distribution of polar bears and their prey over large, remote areas.},

  abstract = {Six baleen whale species are found in the temperate western North Atlantic Ocean, with limited information existing on the distribution and movement patterns for most. There is mounting evidence of distributional shifts in many species, including marine mammals, likely because of climate-driven changes in ocean temperature and circulation. Previous acoustic studies examined the occurrence of minke (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and North Atlantic right whales (NARW; Eubalaena glacialis). This study assesses the acoustic presence of humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), sei (B. borealis), fin (B. physalus), and blue whales (B. musculus) over a decade, based on daily detections of their vocalizations. Data collected from 2004 to 2014 on 281 bottommounted recorders, totaling 35,033 days, were processed using automated detection software and screened for each species' presence. A published study on NARW acoustics revealed significant changes in occurrence patterns between the periods of 2004\textendash 2010 and 2011\textendash 2014; therefore, these same time periods were examined here. All four species were present from the Southeast United States to Greenland; humpback whales were also present in the Caribbean. All species occurred throughout all regions in the winter, suggesting that baleen whales are widely distributed during these months. Each of the species showed significant changes in acoustic occurrence after 2010. Similar to NARWs, sei whales had higher acoustic occurrence in mid-Atlantic regions after 2010. Fin, blue, and sei whales were more frequently detected in the northern latitudes of the study area after 2010. Despite this general northward shift, all four species were detected less on the Scotian Shelf area after 2010, matching documented shifts in prey availability in this region. A decade of acoustic observations have shown important distributional changes over the range of baleen whales, mirroring known climatic shifts and identifying new habitats that will require further protection from anthropogenic threats like fixed fishing gear, shipping, and noise pollution.},

  abstract = {We describe NIMBLE, a system for programming statistical algorithms for general model structures within R. NIMBLE is designed to meet three challenges: flexible model specification, a language for programming algorithms that can use different models, and a balance between high-level programmability and execution efficiency. For model specification, NIMBLE extends the BUGS language and creates model objects, which can manipulate variables, calculate log probability values, generate simulations, and query the relationships among variables. For algorithm programming, NIMBLE provides functions that operate with model objects using two stages of evaluation. The first stage allows specialization of a function to a particular model and/or nodes, such as creating a Metropolis-Hastings sampler for a particular block of nodes. The second stage allows repeated execution of computations using the results of the first stage. To achieve efficient second-stage computation, NIMBLE compiles models and functions via C++, using the Eigen library for linear algebra, and provides the user with an interface to compiled objects. The NIMBLE language represents a compilable domain-specific language (DSL) embedded within R. This paper provides an overview of the design and rationale for NIMBLE along with illustrative examples including importance sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM).},

  abstract = {The Bo\'e sector in southeast Guinea-Bissau harbors a population of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) that inhabits a mosaic of forest and savanna. The Bo\'e sector contains a substantial bauxite deposit in a region called Ronde Hill, and there are plans for the construction of a mine, which may endanger the chimpanzee population. In 1-week survey in May 2013, we used the standing crop nest counts method to obtain the number of chimpanzee nests and from that estimate the density and abundance of chimpanzees. We carried out five 1-km line transects that covered the bauxite deposit and surrounding valleys. We used density surface modeling to analyze habitat preferences, then predicted chimpanzee nest density and distribution based on environmental variables. We found the projected location of the mine partially coincides with an area of high predicted abundances of chimpanzee nests and is surrounded by highly suitable areas for chimpanzees (northeast and southwest). We conclude the mine could have significant direct and indirect effects on this population of chimpanzees whose impacts must be carefully considered and properly mitigated if the mine is built.},

We describe two spatial applications for which Gaussian distributional assumptions are clearly inappropriate. The \textregistered rst concerns the assessment of residual contamination from nuclear weapons testing on a South Paci\textregistered c island, in which the sampling method generates spatially indexed Poisson counts conditional on an unobserved spatially varying intensity of radioactivity; we conclude that a conventional geostatistical analysis oversmooths the data and underestimates the spatial extremes of the intensity. The second application provides a description of spatial variation in the risk of campylobacter infections relative to other enteric infections in part of north Lancashire and south Cumbria. For this application, we treat the data as binomial counts at unit postcode locations, conditionally on an unobserved relative risk surface which we estimate. The theoretical framework for our extension of geostatistical methods is that, conditionally on the unobserved process Sx, observations at sample locations xi form a generalized linear model with the corresponding values of Sxi  appearing as an offset term in the linear predictor. We use a Bayesian inferential framework, implemented via the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, to solve the prediction problem for non-linear functionals of Sx, making a proper allowance for the uncertainty in the estimation of any model parameters.},

They rely on a proper understanding of how environmental drivers determine species occurrence patterns. This understanding is usually derived from an analysis of the species' present distribution by statistical means (species distribution models). Projections based on species distribution models make several assumptions (such as constancy of limiting factors, no evolutionary adaptation to drivers, global dispersal), some of which are ecologically untenable. Also, methodological issues muddy the waters (e.g. spatial autocorrelation, collinearity of drivers). Here, I review the main shortcomings of species distribution models and species distribution projections, identify limits to their use and open a perspective on how to overcome some current obstacles. As a consequence, I caution biogeographers against making projections too lightheartedly and conservation ecologists and policy makers to be aware that there are several unresolved problems.},

  abstract = {In spatial regression models, collinearity between covariates and spatial effects can lead to significant bias in effect estimates. This problem, known as spatial confounding, is encountered modelling forestry data to assess the effect of temperature on tree health. Reliable inference is difficult as results depend on whether or not spatial effects are included in the model. The mechanism behind spatial confounding is poorly understood and methods for dealing with it are limited. We propose a novel approach, spatial+, in which collinearity is reduced by replacing the covariates in the spatial model by their residuals after spatial dependence has been regressed away. Using a thin plate spline model formulation, we recognise spatial confounding as a smoothing-induced bias identified by Rice (1986), and through asymptotic analysis of the effect estimates, we show that spatial+ avoids the bias problems of the spatial model. This is also demonstrated in a simulation study. Spatial+ is straight-forward to implement using existing software and, as the response variable is the same as that of the spatial model, standard model selection criteria can be used for comparisons. A major advantage of the method is also that it extends to models with non-Gaussian response distributions. Finally, while our results are derived in a thin plate spline setting, the spatial+ methodology transfers easily to other spatial model formulations.},

When the regression assumptions hold and the GIS data are free from error, this procedure gives unbiased estimates of the response variable and minimizes the prediction mean squared error. However, when the explanatory variables in the GIS are recorded with substantially greater errors than were present in the training set, this procedure does not minimize the prediction mean squared error. A theoretical argument leads to the proposal of an adaptation for regression equations to minimize the prediction mean squared error. The e\"Aectiveness of this adaptation is demonstrated by a simulation study and by its application to an equation for tree growth rate.},

Different types of covariates, such as the usual covariates with mixed effects, metrical covariates with non-linear effects, unstructured random effects, trend and seasonal components in longitudinal data and spatial covariates, are all treated within the same general framework by assigning appro- priate Markov random field priors with different forms and degrees of smoothness. We applied the approach in several case-studies and consulting cases, showing that the methods are also computationally feasible in problems with many covariates and large data sets. In this paper, we choose two typical applications.},

  abstract = {We propose extensions of penalized spline generalized additive models for analyzing space-time regression data and study them from a Bayesian perspective. Non-linear effects of continuous covariates and time trends are modelled through Bayesian versions of penalized splines, while correlated spatial effects follow a Markov random field prior. This allows to treat all functions and effects within a unified general framework by assigning appropriate priors with different forms and degrees of smoothness. Inference can be performed either with full (FB) or empirical Bayes (EB) posterior analysis. FB inference using MCMC techniques is a slight extension of previous work. For EB inference, a computationally efficient solution is developed on the basis of a generalized linear mixed model representation. The second approach can be viewed as posterior mode estimation and is closely related to penalized likelihood estimation in a frequentist setting. Variance components, corresponding to inverse smoothing parameters, are then estimated by marginal likelihood. We carefully compare both inferential procedures in simulation studies and illustrate them through data applications. The methodology is available in the open domain statistical package BayesX and as an S-plus/R function.},

A geographically stratified analysis, incorporating correction factors for trackline detection probability and availability bias, was used to estimate bowhead whale abundance in three regions. The regional abundance estimate for Amundsen Gulf was 275 whales (CV = 0.550; bootstrap 95\% CI [83, 654]), the eastern Beaufort Sea was 13,207 whales (CV = 0.570; bootstrap 95\% CI [7,108, 27,522]), and the western Beaufort Sea was 1,049 whales (CV = 0.538; bootstrap 95\% CI [252, 2,132]). A bootstrap sensitivity analysis suggested that the largest contributors to the uncertainty in the overall abundance estimate were the trackline detection probability and variability among the line-transect survey sample units. Increasing the sample size of imagery (i.e., the ``independent observer'' in the mark-recapture distancesampling analysis used to estimate trackline detection probability) would likely reduce CV(\dbend\dbend{\^\dbend}\dbend\dbend\dbend ). Efficient and accurate auto-detection algorithms for large cetaceans would help streamline the photo analysis process. Furthermore, spatially explicit density modeling techniques could likely reduce CV(\dbend\dbend{\^\dbend}\dbend\dbend\dbend ) by accounting for the unexplained variability among samples in the geographically stratified analysis.},

These innovations greatly increase the number of capture samples achievable and enable capture-recapture estimation for many inaccessible and elusive species. However, natural features are invariably imperfect as indicators of identity. Drawing on the recently-developed Palm likelihood approach to parameter estimation in clustered point processes, we propose a new estimation framework based on comparing pairs of detections, which we term the trace-contrast framework. Importantly, no reconstruction of capture histories is needed. We show that we can achieve accurate, precise, and computationally fast inference. We illustrate the methods with a camera-trap study of a partially-marked population of ship rats (Rattus rattus) in New Zealand.},

  abstract = {In spatial surveys for estimating the density of objects in a survey region, systematic designs will generally yield lower variance than random designs. However, estimating the systematic variance is well known to be a difficult problem. Existing methods tend to overestimate the variance, so although the variance is genuinely reduced, it is over-reported, and the gain from the more efficient design is lost. The current approaches to estimating a systematic variance for spatial surveys are to approximate the systematic design by a random design, or approximate it by a stratified design. Previous work has shown that approximation by a random design can perform very poorly, while approximation by a stratified design is an improvement but can still be severely biased in some situations. We develop a new estimator based on modeling the encounter process over space. The new ``striplet'' estimator has negligible bias and excellent precision in a wide range of simulation scenarios, including strip-sampling, distance-sampling, and quadrat-sampling surveys, and including populations that are highly trended or have strong aggregation of objects. We apply the new estimator to survey data for the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, and find that the reported coefficient of variation for estimated density is 20\% using approximation by a random design, 17\% using approximation by a stratified design, and 11\% using the new striplet estimator. This large reduction in reported variance is verified by simulation.},

  abstract = {Seabirds are vulnerable to incidental harm from human activities in the ocean, and knowledge of their seasonal distribution is required to assess risk and effectively inform marine conservation planning. Significant hydrocarbon discoveries and exploration licenses in the Labrador Sea underscore the need for quantitative information on seabird seasonal distribution and abundance, as this region is known to provide important habitat for seabirds year-round. We explore the utility of density surface modeling (DSM) to improve seabird information available for regional conservation and management decision making. We, (1) develop seasonal density surface models for seabirds in the Labrador Sea using data from vessel-based surveys (2006\textendash 2014; 13,783 linear km of surveys), (2) present measures of uncertainty in model predictions, (3) discuss how density surface models can inform conservation and management decision making, and 4) explore challenges and potential pitfalls associated with using these modeling procedures. Models predicted large areas of high seabird density in fall over continental shelf waters (max. {$\sim$}80 birds{$\cdot$}km-2) driven largely by the southward migration of murres (Uria spp.) and dovekies (Alle alle) from Arctic breeding colonies. The continental shelf break was also highlighted as an important habitat feature, with predictions of high seabird densities particularly during summer (max. {$\sim$}70 birds{$\cdot$}km-2). Notable concentrations of seabirds overlapped with several significant hydrocarbon discoveries on the continental shelf and large areas in the vicinity of the southern shelf break, which are in the early stages of exploration. Some, but not all, areas of high seabird density were within current Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area (EBSA) boundaries. Building predictive spatial models required knowledge of Distance Sampling and GAMs, and significant investments of time and computational power\textemdash resource needs that are becoming more common in ecological modeling. Visualization of predictions and their uncertainty needed to be considered for appropriate interpretation by end users. Model uncertainty tended to be greater where survey effort was limited or where predictor covariates exceeded the range of those observed. Predictive spatial models proved useful in generating defensible estimates of seabird densities in many areas of interest to the oil and gas industry in the Labrador Sea, and will have continued use in marine risk assessments and spatial planning activities in the region and beyond.},

  abstract = {Trends in population abundance are often used to monitor species affected by human activities. For highly mobile species in dynamic environments, however, such as cetaceans in the marine realm, natural variability can confound attempts to detect and interpret trends in abundance. Environmental variability can cause dramatic shifts in the distribution of cetaceans, and thus abundance estimates for a fixed region may be based on a different proportion of the population each time. This adds variability, decreasing statistical power to detect trends and introducing uncertainty whether apparent trends represent true changes in population size or merely reflect natural changes in the distribution of cetaceans. To minimize these problems, surveys ideally would be based on species-specific design criteria that optimize sampling within all relevant habitat throughout a species' range. Our knowledge of cetacean habitats is limited, however, and financial and logistic constraints generally force those surveying cetacean abundance to include all species within a limited geographic region. Alternately, it may be possible to account for environmental variability analytically by including models of species-environment patterns in trend analyses, but this will be successful only if such models have interannual predictive power. I developed and evaluated generalized additive models of cetacean sighting rates in relation to environmental variables. I used data from shipboard surveys of Dall's porpoise ( Phocoenoides dalli) and short-beaked common dolphins ( Delphinus delphis) conducted in 1991, 1993, and 1996 off California. Sighting rates for these two species are variable and can be partially accounted for by environmental models, but additional surveys are needed to model species-environment relationships adequately. If patterns are consistent across years, generalized additive models may represent an effective tool for reducing uncertainty caused by environmental variability and for improving our ability to detect and interpret trends in abundance.},

In the USA, Environmental Assessments or Environmental Impact Statements evaluating potential impacts are required, and these must include information on the expected number of cetaceans in specific areas where activities will occur. Typically, however, such information is only available for broad geographic regions, e.g. the entire West Coast of the United States. We present species-habitat models that estimate finer scale cetacean densities within the eastern Pacific Ocean. The models were developed and validated for 22 species or species groups, based on 15 large-scale shipboard cetacean and ecosystem assessment surveys conducted in the temperate and tropical eastern Pacific during the period from 1986 to 2006. Model development included consideration of different modeling frameworks, spatial and temporal resolutions of input variables, and spatial interpolation techniques. For the final models, expected group encounter rate and group size were modeled separately, using generalized additive models, as functions of environmental predictors, including bathymetry, distance to shore or isobaths, sea surface temperature (SST), variance in SST, salinity, chlorophyll, and mixed-layer depth. Model selection was performed using cross-validation on novel data. Smoothed maps of species density (and variance therein) were created from the final models for the California Current Ecosystem and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. Model results were integrated into a web-interface that allows end-users to estimate densities for specified areas and provides fine-scale information for marine mammal assessments, monitoring, and mitigation.},

Studies of the abundance and distribution of cetaceans within these dynamic marine ecosystems have generally been patchy or conducted at coarse spatial and temporal scales, limiting their utility for pelagic conservation planning. Habitat-based density models provide a tool for identifying pelagic areas of importance to cetaceans, because model predictions are spatially explicit. In this study, we present habitat-based models of cetacean density that were developed and validated for the central North Pacific. Spatial predictions of cetacean densities and measures of uncertainty were derived based on data collected during 15 large-scale shipboard cetacean and ecosystem assessment surveys conducted from 1997 to 2012. We developed generalized additive models using static and remotely sensed dynamic habitat variables, including distance to land, sea-surface temperature (SST), standard deviation of SST, surface chlorophyll concentration, seasurface height (SSH), and SSH root-mean-square variation. The resulting models, developed using new grid-based prediction methods, provide finer scale information on the distribution and density of cetaceans than previously available. Habitat-based abundance estimates around Hawaii are similar to those derived from standard line-transect analyses of the same data and provide enhanced spatial resolution to inform management and conservation of pelagic cetacean species.},

We study the challenges involved in applying a flexible non-stationary model to a dataset of annual precipitation in the conterminous US, where exploratory data analysis shows strong evidence of a non-stationary covariance structure. The aim of this paper is to investigate the modelling pipeline once non-stationarity has been detected in spatial data. We show that there is a real danger of over-fitting the model and that careful modelling is necessary in order to properly account for varying second-order structure. In fact, the example shows that sometimes non-stationary Gaussian random fields are not necessary to model non-stationary spatial data.},

It may come as a surprise that the Kriging estimator, normally derived as the best linear unbiased estimator, is also the solution of a particular variational problem. Thus, Kriging estimators can also be interpreted as generalized smoothing splines where the roughness penalty is determined by the covariance function of a spatial process. We build off the early work by Silverman (1982, 1984) and the analysis by Cox (1983, 1984), Messer (1991), Messer and Goldstein (1993) and others and develop an equivalent kernel interpretation of geostatistical estimators. Given this connection we show how a given covariance function influences the bias and variance of the Kriging estimate as well as the mean squared prediction error. Some specific asymptotic results are given for one dimensional corresponding Mat\textasciiacute ern covariances that have as their limit cubic smoothing splines.},

We suggest instead to use a uniform prior on the hierarchical standard deviation, using the half-t family when the number of groups is small and in other settings where a weakly informative prior is desired. We also illustrate the use of the half-t family for hierarchical modeling of multiple variance parameters such as arise in the analysis of variance.},

Abundance and trends of these dolphin stocks were assessed from 12 large-scale pelagic surveys carried out between 1979 and 2000. Estimates of abundance were based on a multivariate linetransect analysis, using covariates to model the detection process and group size. Current estimates of abundance are about 640 000 northeastern offshore spotted dolphins (CV = 0.17) and 450 000 eastern spinner dolphins (CV = 0.23). For the whole period from 1979 to 2000, annual estimates of abundance ranged from 494 000 to 954 000 for northeastern offshore spotted dolphins and from 271 000 to 734 000 for eastern spinner dolphins. Management actions by USA and international fishing agencies over 3 decades have successfully reduced dolphin bycatch by 2 orders of magnitude, yet neither stock is showing clear signs of recovery. Possible reasons include underreporting of dolphin bycatch, effects of chase and encirclement on dolphin survival and reproduction, longterm changes in the ecosystem, and effects of other species on spotted and spinner dolphin population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Effective species conservation and management requires information on species distribution patterns, which is challenging for highly mobile and cryptic species that may be subject to multiple anthropogenic stressors across international boundaries. Understanding species\textendash h\- abitat relationships can improve the assessment of trends and distribution by explicitly allowing high-\-resolution data on habitats to inform abundance estimation and the identification of protected areas. In this study, we aggregated an unprecedented set of survey data of a marine top predator, the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), collected in the UK (SCANS II, Dogger Bank), Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark, to develop seasonal habitat-\-based density models for the central and southern North Sea. Visual survey data were collected over 9 yr (2005\textendash 2013) by means of dedicated line-\-transect surveys, taking into account the proportion of missed sightings. Generalized additive models of porpoise density were fitted to 156,630 km of on-e\- ffort survey data with 14,356 sightings of porpoise groups. Selected predictors included static and dynamic variables, such as depth, distance to shore and to sandeel (Ammodytes spp.) grounds, sea surface temperature (SST), proxies for fronts, and day length. Day length and the spatial distribution of daily SST proved to be good proxies for ``season,'' allowing predictions in both space and time. The density models captured seasonal distribution shifts of porpoises across international boundaries. By combining the large-\-scale international SCANS II survey with the more frequent, small-s\- cale national surveys, it has been possible to provide seasonal maps that will be used to assist the EU Habitats and Marine Strategy Framework Directives in effectively assessing the conservation status of harbor porpoises. Moreover, our results can facilitate the identification of regions where human activities and disturbances are likely to impact the population and are especially relevant for marine spatial planning, which requires accurate fine-\-scale maps of species distribution to assess risks of increasing human activities at sea.},

  abstract = {Statistical modelling is used throughout the sciences. Often, statistical analyses require custom models that cannot be fitted using off-the shelf statistical software. These models can be specified in a statistical syntax and can then be automatically fit to data using methods such as Markov Chain monte Carlo (MCMC) and maximum likelihood. This lets users focus on the statistical nature of the model, rather than implementation details and inference procedures. Since the development of the widely successful WinBUGS (later developed as OpenBUGS; Spiegelhalter, Thomas, Best, \& Lunn (2014)) a number of alternative software packages for custom statistical modelling have been introduced, including JAGS, Stan, and NIMBLE (Carpenter et al., 2017; de Valpine et al., 2017; Plummer \& others, 2003). In these software packages, users typically write out models in a domain-specific language, which is then compiled into computational code. Though see the Python packages PyMC and Edward (Salvatier, Wiecki, \& Fonnesbeck, 2016; Tran et al., 2016) in which models are specified in Python code.},

The method is to subtract a roughness penalty from the log likelihood, where the roughness penalty is a certain functional of the assumed density function f. Those used are linear combinations off y'2dx andf y"2dx, where y = If. The method appears to be consistent under wide conditions, although consistent methods can be rough. Numerical examples are given and show that for certain values of the coefficients in this linear expression the density function turns out to be very smooth even when N is small. Multivariate extensions are proposed, including one to distributions having some continuous and some discrete components, but numerical examples of these have not been tried. Some of the techniques are borrowed from quantum mechanics and tensor calculus.},

The cross-validated smoothing spline can be used to estimate g non-parametrically from observations on Y(ti), i = 1, 2, . . ., n, and the purpose of this paper is to study confidence intervals for this estimate. Properties of smoothing splines as Bayes estimates are used to derive confidence intervals based on the posterior covariance function of the estimate. A small Monte Carlo study with the cubic smoothing spline is carried out to suggest by example to what extent the resulting 95 per cent confidence intervals can be expected to cover about 95 per cent of the true (but in practice unknown) values of g(ti), i = 1, 2,. . ., n. The method was also applied to one example of a twodimensional thin plate smoothing spline. An asymptotic theoretical argument is presented to explain why the method can be expected to work on fixed smooth functions (like those tried), which are "smoother" than the sample functions from the prior distributions on which the confidence interval theory is based.\vphantom\}},

  abstract = {In linear mixed models, model selection frequently includes the selection of random effects. Two versions of the Akaike information criterion, AIC, have been used, based either on the marginal or on the conditional distribution. We show that the marginal AIC is not an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the Akaike information, and favours smaller models without random effects. For the conditional AIC, we show that ignoring estimation uncertainty in the random effects covariance matrix, as is common practice, induces a bias that can lead to the selection of any random effect not predicted to be exactly zero. We derive an analytic representation of a corrected version of the conditional AIC, which avoids the high computational cost and imprecision of available numerical approximations. An implementation in an R package (R Development Core Team, 2010) is provided. All theoretical results are illustrated in simulation studies, and their impact in practice is investigated in an analysis of childhood malnutrition in Zambia.},

The main concerns in solving the optimization problem are the speed and the reliability of the algorithm, as well as the invariance of the algorithm under transformations under which the problem itself is invariant. The proposed algorithm is believed to be highly efficient for the problem, though it is still rather expensive for large data sets, since its operational counts are (2/3)kn + O(n2), with k the number of smoothing parameters and n the number of observations. Sensible procedures for computing good starting values are also proposed, which should help in keeping the execution load to the minimum possible. The algorithm is implemented in Rkpack [RKPACK and its applications: Fitting smoothing spline models, Tech. Report 857, Department of Statistics, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, 1989] and illustrated by examples of fitting additive and interaction spline models. It is noted that the algorithm can also be applied to the maximum likelihood (ML) and the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation of the variance component models.},

It is standard practice to use ordinary regression techniques with an ordinal response that has that many categories. We give evidence for these data that the constraints on the response result in a misleading regression analysis. McCullagh's" proportional-odds model is designed specificallyfor the regression analysis of ordinal data. We demonstrate the technique on these data, and show how it fills the gap between ordinary regressionand logistic regression (for discrete data with two categories).In addition, we demonstrate non-parametric versions of these models that do not make any linearity assumptions about the regression function.},

As such they can be computed for any statistical model, making it possible, in principle, to derive the number of parameters in machine-learning approaches. Defined originally for normally distributed data only, we here investigate the potential of this approach for Bernoulli-data. GDF-values for models of simulated and real data are compared to model complexity-estimates from cross-validation. Similarly, we computed GDF-based AICc for randomForest, neural networks and boosted regression trees and demonstrated its similarity to cross-validation. GDF-estimates for binary data were unstable and inconsistently sensitive to the number of data points perturbed simultaneously, while at the same time being extremely computer-intensive in their calculation. Repeated 10-fold cross-validation was more robust, based on fewer assumptions and faster to compute. Our findings suggest that the GDF-approach does not readily transfer to Bernoulli data and a wider range of regression approaches.},

On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers\textemdash 8\texttimes{} deeper than VGG nets [41] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task.

Many of the statistical methods used to account for autocorrelation can be viewed as regression models that include basis functions. Understanding the concept of basis functions enables ecologists to modify commonly used ecological models to account for autocorrelation, which can improve inference and predictive accuracy. Understanding the properties of basis functions is essential for evaluating the fit of spatial or time-series models, detecting a hidden form of multicollinearity, and analyzing large data sets. We present important concepts and properties related to basis functions and illustrate several tools and techniques ecologists can use when modeling autocorrelation in ecological data.},

A total of 8,670km of survey effort covered 11 strata in sea states {$<$}5 with a total stratum area of 213,807km2. The 27 sightings of common minke whales were all within a strip width of 300m and the average time from first detection to when the sighting passed abeam was 1.7 sec. Due to the uniform and narrow distribution of the detections, strip census methods were used to analyse the survey. Two methods were deployed to correct the strip census estimates for whales missed by the observers and whales that were submerged during the passage of the plane. Method 1 included all detections of common minke whales (n = 27) and correction for an instantaneous availability that included submergence of whales. Using data from sea states {$<$}3 (n = 22) the `at surface' abundance of common minke whales was 1,866 (CV = 0.30) whales. A correction for whales missed by the observers with a simple mark-recapture estimator resulted in a corrected abundance of 1,904 (CV = 0.30) whales. Adjusting for the availability bias resulted in a fully corrected estimate of 16,609 (95\% CI 7,172\textendash 38,461) common minke whales. Method 2 used only detections of common minke whales that were observed to break the surface (n = 19). Applying this method to effort data at sea state {$<$}3 (n = 14) resulted in an `at surface' abundance of 1,174 (CV = 0.39) whales. A correction for whales missed by the observers increased the abundance to 1,198 (0.39) whales. Adjusting for the availability bias resulted in a fully corrected estimate of 22,952 (95\% CI 7,815\textendash 67,403) common minke whales.},

At that time, a random effect was an effect having (in analysis-of-variance jargon) levels that were draws from a population, and the draws were not of interest in themselves but only as samples from the larger population (e.g., Scheff\textasciiacute e 1959, p. 238). By contrast, new-style random effects have levels that are not draws from any population, or that are the entire population, or that may be a sample but a new draw from the random effect could not conceivably be drawn; and the levels themselves are usually of interest. All such new-style random effects can be understood as formal devices to facilitate smoothing or shrinkage, interpreting those terms broadly. The distinction between oldand new-style random effects is not a mere nicety but has practical consequences for inference and prediction, simulation experiments for evaluating statistical methods, and interpretation of analytical artifacts. Therefore, this distinction should be developed beyond the catalog of examples and consequences given here and incorporated into statistical theory and practice.},

Our main result is that a SAR model can be written as a unique CAR model, and while a CAR model can be written as a SAR model, it is not unique. In fact, we show how any multivariate Gaussian distribution on a finite set of points with a positive-definite covariance matrix can be written as either a CAR or a SAR model. We illustrate how to obtain any number of SAR covariance matrices from a single CAR covariance matrix by using Givens rotation matrices on a simulated example. We also discuss sparseness in the original CAR construction, and for the resulting SAR weights matrix. For a real example, we use crime data in 49 neighborhoods from Columbus, Ohio, and show that a geostatistical model optimizes the likelihood much better than typical first-order CAR models. We then use the implied weights from the geostatistical model to estimate CAR model parameters that provides the best overall optimization.},

  abstract = {Vital rates such as survival and recruitment have always been important in the study of population and community ecology. At the individual level, physiological processes such as energetics are critical in understanding biomechanics and movement ecology and also scale up to influence food webs and trophic cascades. Although vital rates and population-level characteristics are tied with individual-level animal movement, most statistical models for telemetry data are not equipped to provide inference about these relationships because they lack the explicit, mechanistic connection to physiological dynamics. We present a framework for modelling telemetry data that explicitly includes an aggregated physiological process associated with decision making and movement in heterogeneous environments. Our framework accommodates a wide range of movement and physiological process specifications. We illustrate a specific model formulation in continuous-time to provide direct inference about gains and losses associated with physiological processes based on movement. Our approach can also be extended to accommodate auxiliary data when available. We demonstrate our model to infer mountain lion (Puma concolor; in Colorado, USA) and African buffalo (Syncerus caffer; in Kruger National Park, South Africa) recharge dynamics.},

The advancement of sub-meter resolution imagery has provided greater confidence in the detection and identification of features on the ground, broadening the realm of possible research questions. To date, VHR imagery studies have largely focused on terrestrial environments; however, there has been incremental progress in the last two decades for using this technology to detect cetaceans. With advances in computational power and sensor resolution, the feasibility of broad-scale VHR ocean surveys using VHR satellite imagery with automated detection and classification processes has increased. Initial attempts at automated surveys are showing promising results, but further development is necessary to ensure reliability. Here we discuss the future directions in which VHR satellite imagery might be used to address urgent questions in whale conservation. We highlight the current challenges to automated detection and to extending the use of this technology to all oceans and various whale species. To achieve basin-scale marine surveys, currently not feasible with any traditional surveying methods (including boat-based and aerial surveys), future research requires a collaborative effort between biology, computation science, and engineering to overcome the present challenges to this platform's use.},

We exhibit various examples of fitting procedures for which degrees of freedom is not monotonic in the model complexity parameter, and can exceed the total dimension of the largest model. Even in very simple settings, the degrees of freedom can exceed the dimension of the ambient space by an arbitrarily large amount.},

The log-linear model that describes the counts in the resulting contingency table implies a specific logistic regression model, with the binary variable as the outcome. Extending results in Christensen (1997), by also considering the case where factors present in the contingency table disappear from the logistic regression model, we prove that the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) for the parameters of the logistic regression equals the MLE for the corresponding parameters of the log-linear model. We prove that, asymptotically, standard errors for the two sets of parameters are also equal. Subsequently, Wald confidence intervals are asymptotically equal. These results demonstrate the extent to which inferences from the log-linear framework can be translated to inferences within the logistic regression framework, on the magnitude of main effects and interactions. Finally, we prove that the deviance of the log-linear model is equal to the deviance of the corresponding logistic regression, provided that the latter is fitted to a dataset where no cell observations are merged when one or more factors in \$\textbackslash mathcal\{P\} \textbackslash setminus \textbackslash\{ Y \textbackslash\}\$ become obsolete. We illustrate the derived results with the analysis of a real dataset.},

Researchers are turning to UAS platforms for population assessment purposes because they may provide flexible, safe, and low-cost data collection. In these cases, it is important that the accuracy and precision of UAS-based approaches are evaluated to ensure data quality and comparability with legacy data. The present study compares image quality and survey performance of two small UAS with that of an occupied aircraft as applied to a population survey and molt-stage assessment of gray seals (Halichoerus grypus) in the northeastern United States. Population surveys using fixedwing UAS and occupied aircraft provided similar quality imagery with only minor deviations in counts of both adult seals ({$<$}1\% difference) and pups (3.7\% difference). The multicopter UAS proved especially useful for molt-stage assessment when compared to both fixed-wing UAS and occupied aircraft surveys. The results of this study clearly illustrate that small UAS are reliable tools for conducting population assessments of pinnipeds and establishing life history stages of animals. These new tools provide flexibility in operations and may reduce costs and human risk in some cases.},

Yet habitat models fit to these data are blind to the underlying behavioural context. Conversely, behavioural models accounting for individual variability are too slow for meaningful analysis of large telemetry datasets. Applying new fast-estimation tools, we show how a model incorporating mixed effects within a flexible random walk movement process rapidly infers among-individual variability in environment-movement behaviour relationships. We demonstrate our approach using southern elephant seal (                          ) telemetry data. Seals consistently reduced speed and directionality (move persistence) with increasing sea ice coverage, had variable responses to chlorophyll concentration and consistently reduced move persistence in regions where circumpolar deep water shoaled. Our new modelling framework is extensible and substantively advances analysis of telemetry data by allowing fast and flexible mixed effects estimation of potential drivers of movement behaviour processes.},

Overall, ,25\% of the world's ocean surface was surveyed and only 6\% had been covered frequently enough (\$5 times) to allow trend estimation. Almost half the global survey effort, defined as total area (km2) covered by all survey study areas across time, was concentrated in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP). Neither the number of surveys conducted nor the survey effort had increased in recent years. Across species, an average of 10\% of a species' predicted range had been covered by at least one survey, but there was considerable variation among species. With the exception of three delphinid species, ,1\% of all species' ranges had been covered frequently enough for trend analysis. Sperm whales emerged from our analyses as a relatively data-rich species. This is a notoriously difficult species to survey visually, and we use this as an example to illustrate the challenges of using available data from line-transect surveys for the detection of trends or for spatial planning. We propose field and analytical methods to fill in data gaps to improve cetacean conservation efforts.},

  abstract = {The lack of comprehensive sighting data sets precludes the application of standard habitat suitability modeling approaches to predict distributions of the majority of marine mammal species on very large scales. As an alternative, we developed an ecological niche model to map global distributions of 115 cetacean and pinniped species living in the marine environment using more readily available expert knowledge about habitat usage. We started by assigning each species to broad-scale niche categories with respect to depth, sea-surface temperature, and ice edge association based on synopses of published information. Within a global information system framework and a global grid of 0.5\textdegree{} latitude/longitude cell dimensions, we then generated an index of the relative environmental suitability (RES) of each cell for a given species by relating known habitat usage to local environmental conditions. RES predictions closely matched published maximum ranges for most species, thus representing useful, more objective alternatives to existing sketched distributional outlines. In addition, raster-based predictions provided detailed information about heterogeneous patterns of potentially suitable habitat for species throughout their range. We tested RES model outputs for 11 species (northern fur seal, harbor porpoise, sperm whale, killer whale, hourglass dolphin, fin whale, humpback whale, blue whale, Antarctic minke, and dwarf minke whales) from a broad taxonomic and geographic range, using data from dedicated surveys. Observed encounter rates and species-specific predicted environmental suitability were significantly and positively correlated for all but 1 species. In comparison, encounter rates were correlated with {$<$}1\% of 1000 simulated random data sets for all but 2 species. Mapping of large-scale marine mammal distributions using this environmental envelope model is helpful for evaluating current assumptions and knowledge about species' occurrences, especially for data-poor species. Moreover, RES modeling can help to focus research efforts on smaller geographic scales and usefully supplement other, statistical, habitat suitability models.},

For the goal of estimating average treatment effects, we propose to fit a model allowing treatment to interact with background variables and then average over the distribution of these variables in the population. This can be seen as an extension of multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP), a method used in political science and other areas of survey research, where researchers wish to generalize from a sparse and possibly non-representative sample to the general population. In this paper, we discuss areas where this method can be used in the psychological sciences. We use our method to estimate the norming distribution for the Big Five Personality Scale using open source data. We argue that large open data sources like this and other collaborative data sources can be combined with MRP to help resolve current challenges of generalizability and replication in psychology.},

The computation of smoothing splines is generally of the order O.n3/, n being the sample size, which severely limits its practical applicability. We study more scalable computation of smoothing spline regression via certain low dimensional approximations that are asymptotically as efficient. A simple algorithm is presented and the Bayes model that is associated with the approximations is derived, with the latter guiding the porting of Bayesian confidence intervals. The practical choice of the dimension of the approximating space is determined through simulation studies, and empirical comparisons of the approximations with the exact solution are presented. Also evaluated is a simple modification of the generalized cross-validation method for smoothing parameter selection, which to a large extent fixes the occasional undersmoothing problem that is suffered by generalized cross-validation.},

We consider the special case of structured additive distributional regression where Gaussian priors are used to enforce specific properties such as smoothness or shrinkage on various effect types combined in predictors for multiple parameters related to the distribution of the response. Relying on a recently proposed class of penalised complexity priors motivated from a general set of construction principles, we derive a hyperprior structure where prior elicitation is facilitated by assumptions on the scaling of the different effect types. The posterior distribution is assessed with an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme and conditions for its propriety are studied theoretically. We investigate the new type of scaledependent priors in simulations and two challenging applications, in particular in comparison to the standard inverse gamma priors but also alternatives such as half-normal, half-Cauchy and proper uniform priors for standard deviations.},

  author = {Kneib, Thomas},

  abstract = {Semiparametric regression models offer considerable flexibility concerning the specification of additive regression predictors including effects as diverse as nonlinear effects of continuous covariates, spatial effects, random effects, or varying coefficients. Recently, such flexible model predictors have been combined with the possibility to go beyond pure mean-based analyses by specifying regression predictors on potentially all parameters of the response distribution in a distributional regression framework. In this paper, we discuss a generic concept for defining interaction effects in such semiparametric distributional regression models based on tensor products of main effects. These interactions can be assigned anisotropic penalties, i.e. different amounts of smoothness will be associated with the interacting covariates. We investigate identifiability and the decomposition of interactions into main effects and pure interaction effects (similar as in a smoothing spline analysis of variance) to facilitate a modular model building process. The decomposition is based on orthogonality in function spaces which allows for considerable flexibility in setting up the effect decomposition. Inference is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations with iteratively weighted least squares proposals under constraints to ensure identifiability and effect decomposition. One important aspect is therefore to maintain sparse matrix structures of the tensor product also in identifiable, decomposed model formulations. The performance of modular regression is verified in a simulation on decomposed interaction surfaces of two continuous covariates and two applications on the construction of spatio-temporal interactions for the analysis of precipitation on the one hand and functional random effects for analysing house prices on the other hand.},

The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach proposed by Rue, Martino, and Chopin (2009) is a computationally effective alternative to MCMC for Bayesian inference. INLA is designed for latent Gaussian models, a very wide and flexible class of models ranging from (generalized) linear mixed to spatial and spatio-temporal models. Combined with the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation approach (SPDE, Lindgren and Lindgren 2011), one can accommodate all kinds of geographically referenced data, including areal and geostatistical ones, as well as spatial point process data. The implementation interface covers stationary spatial models, non-stationary spatial models, and also spatio-temporal models, and is applicable in epidemiology, ecology, environmental risk assessment, as well as general geostatistics.},

  abstract = {Continuously indexed Gaussian fields (GFs) are the most important ingredient in spatial statistical modelling and geostatistics. The specification through the covariance function gives an intuitive interpretation of the field properties. On the computational side, GFs are hampered with the big n problem, since the cost of factorizing dense matrices is cubic in the dimension. Although computational power today is at an all time high, this fact seems still to be a computational bottleneck in many applications. Along with GFs, there is the class of Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) which are discretely indexed. The Markov property makes the precision matrix involved sparse, which enables the use of numerical algorithms for sparse matrices, that for fields in R2 only use the square root of the time required by general algorithms. The specification of a GMRF is through its full conditional distributions but its marginal properties are not transparent in such a parameterization. We show that, using an approximate stochastic weak solution to (linear) stochastic partial differential equations, we can, for some GFs in the Mat\'ern class, provide an explicit link , for any triangulation of Rd , between GFs and GMRFs, formulated as a basis function representation. The consequence is that we can take the best from the two worlds and do the modelling by using GFs but do the computations by using GMRFs. Perhaps more importantly, our approach generalizes to other covariance functions generated by SPDEs, including oscillating and non-stationary GFs, as well as GFs on manifolds. We illustrate our approach by analysing global temperature data with a non-stationary model defined on a sphere.},

  abstract = {In aquatic studies, spatial interactions may be both easier to interpret and to quantify by using water distance than by using geographic distance. The water distance is the shortest path between those two sites that may be traversed entirely over water. One problem is that water distances may be non-Euclidean, and thus covariance and variogram functions are not necessarily valid when using the water distance as a distance metric. Another problem is that the computation of water distances for a large set of spatial locations is computationally expensive. Our alternative is a computationally efficient method for calculation of a Euclidean approximation to water distances. The first step of the method is to define a triangular grid covering the complex domain of interest. Using this triangular grid, we pre-compute approximate water distances using a graph search algorithm. These water distances are then approximated by multidimensional scaling, giving a Euclidean space. Finally, we use linear interpolation to move the data locations into the new Euclidean space. By using this method, subsequent computations of water distances between any locations can be done very fast and the method leads to a theoretically valid spatial covariance model. We apply our method to herring data from the Vestfjord system in Northern Norway. Copyright \# 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

From a Bayesian perspective, a choice of a neural network model can be viewed as de ning a prior probability distribution over non-linear functions, and the neural network's learning process can be interpreted in terms of the posterior probability distribution over the unknown function. (Some learning algorithms search for the function with maximum posterior probability and other Monte Carlo methods draw samples from this posterior probability). In the limit of large but otherwise standard networks, Neal (1996) has shown that the prior distribution over non-linear functions implied by the Bayesian neural network falls in a class of probability distributions known as Gaussian processes. The hyperparameters of the neural network model determine the characteristic lengthscales of the Gaussian process. Neal's observation motivates the idea of discarding parameterized networks and working directly with Gaussian processes. Computations in which the parameters of the network are optimized are then replaced by simple matrix operations using the covariance matrix of the Gaussian process.},

  abstract = {An implicit assumption of standard line transect methodology is that detection probabilities depend solely on the perpendicular distance of detected objects to the transect line. Heterogeneity in detection probabilities is commonly minimized using stratification, but this may be precluded by small sample sizes. We develop a general methodology which allows the effects of multiple covariates to be directly incorporated into the estimation procedure using a conditional likelihood approach. Small sample size properties of estimators are examined via simulations. As an example the method is applied to eastern tropical Pacific dolphin sightings data.},

  abstract = {Classical regression model literature has generally assumed that measured and unmeasured covariates are statistically independent. For many applications, this assumption is clearly tenuous. When unobservables are associated with included regressors and have an impact on the response, standard estimation methods will not be valid. This means that estimation results from observational studies, whose aim is to evaluate the impact of a treatment of interest on a response variable, will be biased and inconsistent in the presence of unmeasured confounders. One method for obtaining consistent estimates of treatment effects when dealing with linear models is the instrumental variable (IV) approach. Linear models have been extended to generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs), and although IV methods have been proposed to deal with GLMs, fitting methods to carry out IV analysis within the GAM context have not been developed. We propose a simple but effective two-stage procedure for IV estimation when dealing with GAMs represented using any penalized regression spline approach and a correction procedure for confidence intervals. We explain under which conditions the proposed method works and illustrate its empirical validity through an extensive simulation experiment and a health study where unmeasured confounding is suspected to be present.},

Increasingly, modellers are tasked with integrating data from multiple sources, collected via different observation processes. Distance sampling is an efficient and widely used survey and analysis technique. Within this framework, observation processes are modelled via detection functions. We seek to take multiple data sources and fit them in a single spatial model. Density surface models (DSMs) are a two-stage approach: first accounting for detectability via distance sampling methods, then modelling distribution via a generalized additive model. However, current software and theory does not address the issue of multiple data sources. We extend the DSM approach to accommodate data from multiple surveys, collected via conventional distance sampling, double-observer distance sampling (used to account for incomplete detection at zero distance) and strip transects. Variance propagation ensures that uncertainty is correctly accounted for in final estimates of abundance. Methods described here are implemented in the dsm R package. We briefly analyse two datasets to illustrate these new developments. Our new methodology enables data from multiple distance sampling surveys of different types to be treated in a single spatial model, enabling more robust abundance estimation, potentially over wider geographical or temporal domains.},

  abstract = {Most conventional spatial smoothers smooth with respect to the Euclidean distance between observations, even though this distance may not be a meaningful measure of spatial proximity, especially when boundary features are present. When domains have complicated boundaries leakage (the inappropriate linking of parts of the domain which are separated by physical barriers) can occur. To overcome this problem, we develop a method of smoothing with respect to generalized distances, such as within domain distances. We obtain the generalized distances between our points and then use multidimensional scaling to find a configuration of our observations in a Euclidean space of 2 or more dimensions, such that the Euclidian distances between points in that space closely approximate the generalized distances between the points. Smoothing is performed over this new point configuration, using a conventional smoother. To mitigate the problems associated with smoothing in high dimensions we use a generalization of thin plate spline smoothers proposed by Duchon (Constructive theory of functions of several variables, pp 85\textendash 100, 1977). This general method for smoothing with respect to generalized distances improves on the performance of previous within-domain distance spatial smoothers, and often provides a more natural model than the soap film approach of Wood et al. (J R Stat Soc Ser B Stat Methodol 70(5):931\textendash 955, 2008). The smoothers are of the linear basis with quadratic penalty type easily incorporated into a range of statistical models.},

  abstract = {The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) 4-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation systems have been systematically applied to the mesoscale circulation environment of the California Current to demonstrate the performance and practical utility of the various components of ROMS 4D-Var. In particular, we present a comparison of three approaches to 4D-Var, namely: the primal formulation of the incremental strong constraint approach; the dual formulation ``physical-space statistical analysis system''; and the dual formulation indirect representer approach. In agreement with theoretical considerations all three approaches converge to the same ocean circulation estimate when using the same observations and prior information. However, the rate of convergence of the dual formulation was found to be inferior to that of the primal formulation. Other aspects of the 4D-Var performance that relate to the use of multiple outer-loops, preconditioning, and the weak constraint are also explored. A systematic evaluation of the impact of the various components of the 4D-Var control vector (i.e. the initial conditions, surface forcing and open boundary conditions) is also presented. It is shown that correcting for uncertainties in the model initial conditions exerts the largest influence on the ability of the model to fit the available observations. Various important diagnostics of 4D-Var are also examined, including estimates of the posterior error, the information content of the observation array, and innovation-based consistency checks on the prior error assumptions. Using these diagnostic tools, we find that more than 90\% of the observations assimilated into the model provide redundant information. This is a symptom of the large percentage of satellite data that are used and to some extent the nature of the data processing employed. This is the second in a series of three papers describing the ROMS 4D-Var systems.},

  abstract = {There is increasing concern about the potential effects of noise pollution on marine life in the world's oceans. For marine mammals, anthropogenic sounds may cause behavioral disruption, and this can be quantified using a risk function that relates sound exposure to a measured behavioral response. Beaked whales are a taxon of deep diving whales that may be particularly susceptible to naval sonar as the species has been associated with sonar-related mass stranding events. Here we derive the first empirical risk function for Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) by combining in situ data from passive acoustic monitoring of animal vocalizations and navy sonar operations with precise ship tracks and sound field modeling. The hydrophone array at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center, Bahamas, was used to locate vocalizing groups of Blainville's beaked whales and identify sonar transmissions before, during, and after Mid-Frequency Active (MFA) sonar operations. Sonar transmission times and source levels were combined with ship tracks using a sound propagation model to estimate the received level (RL) at each hydrophone. A generalized additive model was fitted to data to model the presence or absence of the start of foraging dives in 30-minute periods as a function of the corresponding sonar RL at the hydrophone closest to the center of each group. This model was then used to construct a risk function that can be used to estimate the probability of a behavioral change (cessation of foraging) the individual members of a Blainville's beaked whale population might experience as a function of sonar RL. The function predicts a 0.5 probability of disturbance at a RL of 150dBrms re mPa (CI: 144 to 155) This is 15dB lower than the level used historically by the US Navy in their risk assessments but 10 dB higher than the current 140 dB step-function.},

  abstract = {Stochastic versions of Gompertz, Ricker, and various other dynamics models play a fundamental role in quantifying strength of density dependence and studying long-\- term dynamics of wildlife populations. These models are frequently estimated using time series of abundance estimates that are inevitably subject to observation error and missing data. This issue can be addressed with a state-\-space modeling framework that jointly estimates the observed data model and the underlying stochastic population dynamics (SPD) model. In cases where abundance data are from multiple locations with a smaller spatial resolution (e.g., from mark\textendash recapture and distance sampling studies), models are conventionally fitted to spatially pooled estimates of yearly abundances. Here, we demonstrate that a spatial version of SPD models can be directly estimated from short time series of spatially referenced distance sampling data in a unified hierarchical state-s\-pace modeling framework that also allows for spatial variance (covariance) in population growth. We also show that a full range of likelihood based inference, including estimability diagnostics and model s\-election, is feasible in this class of models using a data cloning algorithm. We further show through simulation experiments that the hierarchical state-s\-pace framework introduced herein efficiently captures the underlying dynamical parameters and spatial abundance distribution. We apply our methodology by analyzing a time series of line-t\-ransect distance sampling data for fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) off the U.S. west coast. Although there were only seven surveys conducted during the study time frame, 1991\textendash 2014, our analysis detected presence of strong density regulation and provided reliable estimates of fin whale densities. In summary, we show that the integrative framework developed herein allows ecologists to better infer key population characteristics such as presence of density regulation and spatial variability in a population's intrinsic growth potential.},

  abstract = {North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis M\"uller 1776) present an interesting problem for abundance and trend estimation in marine wildlife conservation. They are long lived, individually identifiable, highly mobile, and one of the rarest of cetaceans. Individuals are annually resighted at different rates, primarily due to varying stay durations among several principal habitats within a large geographic range. To date, characterizations of abundance have been produced that use simple accounting procedures with differing assumptions about mortality. To better characterize changing abundance of North Atlantic right whales between 1990 and 2015, we adapted a state\textendash space formulation with Jolly-\-Seber assumptions about population entry (birth and immigration) to individual resighting histories and fit it using empirical Bayes methodology. This hierarchical model included accommodation for the effect of the substantial individual capture heterogeneity. Estimates from this approach were only slightly higher than published accounting procedures, except for the most recent years (when recapture rates had declined substantially). North Atlantic right whales' abundance increased at about 2.8\% per annum from median point estimates of 270 individuals in 1990 to 483 in 2010, and then declined to 2015, when the final estimate was 458 individuals (95\% credible intervals 444\textendash 471). The probability that the population's trajectory post-\-2010 was a decline was estimated at 99.99\%. Of special concern was the finding that reduced survival rates of adult females relative to adult males have produced diverging abundance trends between sexes. Despite constraints in recent years, both biological (whales' distribution changing) and logistical (fewer resources available to collect individual photo-\-identifications), it is still possible to detect this relatively recent, small change in the population's trajectory. This is thanks to the massive dataset of individual North Atlantic right whale identifications accrued over the past three decades. Photo-\-identification data provide biological information that allows more informed inference on the status of this species.},

The log-linear model that describes the counts in the resulting contingency table implies a specific logistic regression model, with the binary variable as the outcome. Within the Bayesian framework, the g-prior and mixtures of g-priors are commonly assigned to the parameters of a generalized linear model. We prove that assigning a g-prior (or a mixture of g-priors) to the parameters of a certain log-linear model designates a g-prior (or a mixture of g-priors) on the parameters of the corresponding logistic regression. By deriving an asymptotic result, and with numerical illustrations, we demonstrate that when a g-prior is adopted, this correspondence extends to the posterior distribution of the model parameters. Thus, it is valid to translate inferences from fitting a log-linear model to inferences within the logistic regression framework, with regard to the presence of main effects and interaction terms.},

The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data.

Manual review of these images to extract data is prohibitive in terms of time and financial resources, thus providing strong incentive to automate this process using computer vision systems. There are potential applications for these automated systems in areas such as surveillance and monitoring, precision agriculture, law enforcement, asset inspection, and wildlife assessment. In this paper, we present an efficient machine learning system for automating the detection of marine species in aerial imagery. The effectiveness of our approach can be credited to the combination of a well-suited region proposal method and the use of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs). In comparison to previous algorithms designed for the same purpose, we have been able to dramatically improve recall to more than 80 \% and improve precision to 27 \% by using DCNNs as the core approach.},

  abstract = {Marine spatial planning provides a comprehensive framework for managing multiple uses of the marine environment and has the potential to minimize environmental impacts and reduce conflicts among users. Spatially explicit assessments of the risks to key marine species from human activities are a requirement of marine spatial planning. We assessed the risk of ships striking humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), blue (Balaenoptera musculus), and fin (Balaenoptera physalus) whales in alternative shipping routes derived from patterns of shipping traffic off Southern California (U.S.A.). Specifically, we developed whale-habitat models and assumed ship-strike risk for the alternative shipping routes was proportional to the number of whales predicted by the models to occur within each route. This definition of risk assumes all ships travel within a single route. We also calculated risk assuming ships travel via multiple routes. We estimated the potential for conflict between shipping and other uses (military training and fishing) due to overlap with the routes. We also estimated the overlap between shipping routes and protected areas. The route with the lowest risk for humpback whales had the highest risk for fin whales and vice versa. Risk to both species may be ameliorated by creating a new route south of the northern Channel Islands and spreading traffic between this new route and the existing route in the Santa Barbara Channel. Creating a longer route may reduce the overlap between shipping and other uses by concentrating shipping traffic. Blue whales are distributed more evenly across our study area than humpback and fin whales; thus, risk could not be ameliorated by concentrating shipping traffic in any of the routes we considered. Reducing ship-strike risk for blue whales may be necessary because our estimate of the potential number of strikes suggests that they are likely to exceed allowable levels of anthropogenic impacts established under U.S. laws.},

  abstract = {The accuracy of estimates of cetacean density from line-transect survey data depends in large part on how visible the target species is to the observer. Behavioural data (i.e. surface and dive times) from government- and industry-funded aerial observation programmes (1980\textendash 2000) were used to calculate availability correction factors needed to estimate the number of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) from aerial survey sighting data. Correction factors were calculated for bowhead whales exposed and not exposed to seismic operations. Travelling non-calf whales were found to be less likely to be available for detection than other whales, and their availability further declined in the presence of seismic operations. Noncalves were also less available to observers during autumn when exposed to seismic operations than when not exposed, regardless of activity (travelling or otherwise). Such differences in availability appear to reflect behavioural responses to the sound of seismic operations that alters the surfacing and diving patterns of bowhead whales. Localised abundance estimated from aerial surveys may range from 3\% to as much as 63\% higher in areas ensonified by seismic operations if correction factors are applied to account for differences in availability associated with the presence of seismic operations, compared to abundance estimates derived from assessments that only account for changes in availability of undisturbed whales. These results provide the first empirical estimates of availability for bowhead whales exposed to seismic operations and highlight the implications of not correcting for disturbance-related availability in density assessments in the vicinity of seismic operations.},

  abstract = {Structured additive regression models are perhaps the most commonly used class of models in statistical applications. It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the following task often encountered in building Bayesian spatial models: construct a homogeneous Gaussian Markov random \textregistered eld (GMRF) on a lattice with correlation properties either as present in some observed data, or consistent with prior knowledge. The Markov property is essential in designing computationally ef\textregistered cient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to analyse such models. We argue that we can restate both tasks as that of \textregistered tting a GMRF to a prescribed stationary Gaussian \textregistered eld on a lattice when both local and global properties are important. We demonstrate that using the Kullback{$\pm$}Leibler discrepancy often fails for this task, giving severely undesirable behaviour of the correlation function for lags outside the neighbourhood. We propose a new criterion that resolves this dif\textregistered culty, and demonstrate that GMRFs with small neighbourhoods can approximate Gaussian \textregistered elds surprisingly well even with long correlation lengths. Finally, we discuss implications of our \textregistered ndings for likelihood based inference for general Markov random \textregistered elds when global properties are also important.},

  abstract = {Population size and habitat-specific abundance estimates are essential for conservation management. A major impediment to obtaining such estimates is that few statistical models are able to simultaneously account for both spatial variation in abundance and heterogeneity in detection probability, and still be amenable to large-scale applications. The hierarchical distance-sampling model of J. A. Royle, D. K. Dawson, and S. Bates provides a practical solution. Here, we extend this model to estimate habitat-specific abundance and rangewide population size of a bird species of management concern, the Island Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma insularis), which occurs solely on Santa Cruz Island, California, USA. We surveyed 307 randomly selected, 300 m diameter, point locations throughout the 250-km2 island during October 2008 and April 2009. Population size was estimated to be 2267 (95\% CI 1613\textendash 3007) and 1705 (1212\textendash 2369) during the fall and spring respectively, considerably lower than a previously published but statistically problematic estimate of 12 500. This large discrepancy emphasizes the importance of proper survey design and analysis for obtaining reliable information for management decisions. Jays were most abundant in low-elevation chaparral habitat; the detection function depended primarily on the percent cover of chaparral and forest within count circles. Vegetation change on the island has been dramatic in recent decades, due to release from herbivory following the eradication of feral sheep (Ovis aries) from the majority of the island in the mid-1980s. We applied best-fit fall and spring models of habitat-specific jay abundance to a vegetation map from 1985, and estimated the population size of A. insularis was 1400\textendash 1500 at that time. The 20\textendash 30\% increase in the jay population suggests that the species has benefited from the recovery of native vegetation since sheep removal. Nevertheless, this jay's tiny range and small population size make it vulnerable to natural disasters and to habitat alteration related to climate change. Our results demonstrate that hierarchical distance-sampling models hold promise for estimating population size and spatial density variation at large scales. Our statistical methods have been incorporated into the R package unmarked to facilitate their use by animal ecologists, and we provide annotated code in the Supplement.},

We exploit the natural nested structure inherent to many model components, which defines the model component to be a flexible extension of a base model. Proper priors are defined to penalise the complexity induced by deviating from the simpler base model and are formulated after the input of a user-defined scaling parameter for that model component, both in the univariate and the multivariate case. These priors are invariant to reparameterisations, have a natural connection to Jeffreys' priors, are designed to support Occam's razor and seem to have excellent robustness properties, all which are highly desirable and allow us to use this approach to define default prior distributions. Through examples and theoretical results, we demonstrate the appropriateness of this approach and how it can be applied in various situations.},

In particular, we discuss the theoretical and practical aspects of fast computation with continuously specified Markovian Gaussian random fields, as well as the clear advantages they offer in terms of clear, parsimonious, and interpretable models of anisotropy and nonstationarity.},

  abstract = {Fitting of non-Gaussian hierarchical random effects models by approximate maximum likelihood can be made automatic to the same extent that Bayesian model fitting can be automated by the program BUGS. The word ``automatic'' means that the technical details of computation are made transparent to the user. This is achieved by combining a technique from computer science known as ``automatic differentiation'' with the Laplace approximation for calculating the marginal likelihood. Automatic differentiation, which should not be confused with symbolic differentiation, is mostly unknown to statisticians, and hence basic ideas and results are reviewed. The computational performance of the approach is compared to that of existing mixed-model software on a suite of datasets selected from the mixed-model literature.},

Under the assumption that the time points of availability follow a Poisson point process, we obtain an analytical expression for the detection function. We discuss different criteria for choosing the hazard function and consider in particular two different parametric families of hazard functions. Discrete and continuous hazard models are compared and the robustness of the discrete model is investigated. Finally, the methodology is applied to data from a survey for minke whales in the northeastern Atlantic.},

  abstract = {The climate regime in the eastern Bering Sea has recently been dominated by a pattern of multi-year stanzas, in which several successive years of minimal sea-ice formation and warm summer temperatures (e.g., 2002\textendash 2005, 2014\textendash 2017) alternate with several years of relatively extensive sea-ice formation and cold summer temperatures (e.g., 2006\textendash 2013). This emerging climate pattern may be forcing long-term changes in the spatial distributions of the Bering Sea's marine fauna. The National Marine Fisheries Service's Alaska Fisheries Science Center recently conducted two bottom trawl surveys covering the entire Bering Sea shelf from the Alaska Peninsula to the Bering Strait. The first, in the summer of 2010, was conducted during a cold year when the majority of the continental shelf was covered by a pool of cold ({$<$}\,2\,\textdegree C) water. The second, in the summer of 2017, was during a warmer year with water temperatures above the long-term survey mean. These two surveys recorded significantly different spatial distributions for populations of several commercially important fish species, including walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), and several flatfish species, as well as jellyfishes. Population shifts included latitudinal displacement as well as variable recruitment success. The large-scale distributional shifts reported here for high-biomass species raise questions about long-term ecosystem impacts, and highlight the need for continued monitoring. They also raise questions about our management strategies for these and other species in Alaska's large marine ecosystems.},

These models have obtained notable gains in accuracy across many NLP tasks. However, these accuracy improvements depend on the availability of exceptionally large computational resources that necessitate similarly substantial energy consumption. As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP. Based on these findings, we propose actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in NLP research and practice.},

  abstract = {Good management models and good models for understanding biology differ in basic philosophy. Management models must facilitate management decisions despite large amounts of uncertainty about the managed populations. Such models must be based on parameters that can be estimated readily, must explicitly account for uncertainty, and should be simple to understand and implement. In contrast, biological models are designed to elucidate the workings of biology and should not be constrained by management concerns. We illustrate the need to incorporate uncertainty in management models by reviewing the inadequacy of using standard biological models to manage marine mammals in the United States. Past management was based on a simple model that, although it may have represented population dynamics adequately, failed as a management tool because the parameter that triggered management action was extremely difficult to estimate for the majority of populations. Uncertainty in parameter estimation resulted in few conservation actions. We describe a recently adopted management scheme that incorporates uncertainty and its resulting implementation. The approach used in this simple management scheme, which was tested by using simulation models, incorporates uncertainty and mandates monitoring abundance and human-caused mortality. Although the entire scheme may be suitable for application to some terrestrial and marine problems, two features are broadly applicable: the incorporation of uncertainty through simulations of management and the use of quantitative management criteria to translate verbal objectives into levels of acceptable risk.},

  abstract = {We assessed scientists' ability to detect declines of marine mammal stocks based on recent levels of survey effort, when the actual decline is precipitous. We defined a precipitous decline as a 50\% decrease in abundance in 15 yr, at which point a stock could be legally classified as ``depleted'' under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act. We assessed stocks for three categories of cetaceans: large whales (n = 23, most of which are listed as endangered), beaked whales (n = 11, potentially vulnerable to anthropogenic noise), and small whales/dolphins/porpoises (n = 69, bycatch in fisheries and important abundant predators), for two categories of pinnipeds with substantially different survey precision: counted on land (n = 13) and surveyed on ice (n = 5), and for a category containing polar bear and sea otter stocks (n = 6). The percentage of precipitous declines that would not be detected as declines was 72\% for large whales, 90\% for beaked whales, and 78\% for dolphins/porpoises, 5\% for pinnipeds on land, 100\% for pinnipeds on ice, and 55\% for polar bears/sea otters (based on a one-tailed t-test, \textvisiblespace{} = 0.05), given the frequency and precision of recent monitoring effort. We recommend alternatives to improve performance.},

  abstract = {Many important ecological questions require accounting for spatial variation in demographic rates (e.g., survival) and population variables (e.g., abundance per unit area). However, ecologists have few spatial modelling approaches that (i) fit directly to spatially referenced data, (ii) represent population dynamics explicitly and mechanistically, and (iii) estimate parameters using rigorous statistical methods. We therefore demonstrate a new and computationally efficient approach to spatial modelling that uses random fields in place of the random variables typically used in spatially aggregated models. We adapt this approach to delay-difference dynamics to estimate the impact of fishing and natural mortality, recruitment, and individual growth on spatial population dynamics for a fish population. In particular, we develop this approach to estimate spatial variation in average production of juvenile fishes (termed recruitment), as well as annual variation in the spatial distribution of recruitment. We first use a simulation experiment to demonstrate that the spatial delay-difference model can, in some cases, explain over 50\% of spatial variance in recruitment. We also apply the spatial delay-difference model to data for rex sole (Glyptocephalus zachirus) in the Gulf of Alaska and show that average recruitment (across all years) is greatest near Kodiak Island but that some years show greatest recruitment in Southeast Alaska or the western Gulf of Alaska. Using model developments and software advances presented here, we argue that future research can develop models to approximate adult movement, incorporate spatial covariates to explain annual variation in recruitment, and evaluate management procedures that use spatially explicit estimates of population abundance.},

  abstract = {Predators and prey assort themselves relative to each other, the availability of resources and refuges, and the temporal and spatial scale of their interaction. Predictive models of predator distributions often rely on these relationships by incorporating data on environmental variability and prey availability to determine predator habitat selection patterns. This approach to predictive modeling holds true in marine systems where observations of predators are logistically difficult, emphasizing the need for accurate models. In this paper, we ask whether including prey distribution data in fine-scale predictive models of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) habitat selection in Florida Bay, Florida, USA, improves predictive capacity. Environmental characteristics are often used as predictor variables in habitat models of top marine predators with the assumption that they act as proxies of prey distribution. We examine the validity of this assumption by comparing the response of dolphin distribution and fish catch rates to the same environmental variables. Next, the predictive capacities of four models, with and without prey distribution data, are tested to determine whether dolphin habitat selection can be predicted without recourse to describing the distribution of their prey. The final analysis determines the accuracy of predictive maps of dolphin distribution produced by modeling areas of high fish catch based on significant environmental characteristics. We use spatial analysis and independent data sets to train and test the models. Our results indicate that, due to high habitat heterogeneity and the spatial variability of prey patches, fine-scale models of dolphin habitat selection in coastal habitats will be more successful if environmental variables are used as predictor variables of predator distributions rather than relying on prey data as explanatory variables. However, predictive modeling of prey distribution as the response variable based on environmental variability did produce high predictive performance of dolphin habitat selection, particularly foraging habitat.},

This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection. Examples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields are provided, including in social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine and more. We propose strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist.

  pages = {20},
  abstract = {In linear regression problems with many predictors, penalized regression techniques are often used to guard against overfitting and to select variables relevant for predicting an outcome variable. Recently, Bayesian penalization is becoming increasingly popular in which the prior distribution performs a function similar to that of the penalty term in classical penalization. Specifically, the so-called shrinkage priors in Bayesian penalization aim to shrink small effects to zero while maintaining true large effects. Compared to classical penalization techniques, Bayesian penalization techniques perform similarly or sometimes even better, and they offer additional advantages such as readily available uncertainty estimates, automatic estimation of the penalty parameter, and more flexibility in terms of penalties that can be considered. However, many different shrinkage priors exist and the available, often quite technical, literature primarily focuses on presenting one shrinkage prior and often provides comparisons with only one or two other shrinkage priors. This can make it difficult for researchers to navigate through the many prior options and choose a shrinkage prior for the problem at hand. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on Bayesian penalization. We provide a theoretical and conceptual comparison of nine different shrinkage priors and parametrize the priors, if possible, in terms of scale mixture of normal distributions to facilitate comparisons. We illustrate different characteristics and behaviors of the shrinkage priors and compare their performance in terms of prediction and variable selection in a simulation study. Additionally, we provide two empirical examples to illustrate the application of Bayesian penalization. Finally, an R package bayesreg is available online (https://github.com/sara-vanerp/bayesreg) which allows researchers to perform Bayesian penalized regression with novel shrinkage priors in an easy manner.},

Our main result is that a SAR model can be written as a unique CAR model, and while a CAR model can be written as a SAR model, it is not unique. In fact, we show how any multivariate Gaussian distribution on a finite set of points with a positive-definite covariance matrix can be written as either a CAR or a SAR model. We illustrate how to obtain any number of SAR covariance matrices from a single CAR covariance matrix by using Givens rotation matrices on a simulated example. We also discuss sparseness in the original CAR construction, and for the resulting SAR weights matrix. For a real example, we use crime data in 49 neighborhoods from Columbus, Ohio, and show that a geostatistical model optimizes the likelihood much better than typical first-order CAR models. We then use the implied weights from the geostatistical model to estimate CAR model parameters that provides the best overall optimization.},

  abstract = {Ecological data often exhibit spatial pattern, which can be modeled as autocorrelation. Conditional autoregressive (CAR) and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models are network-based models (also known as graphical models) specifically designed to model spatially autocorrelated data based on neighborhood relationships. We identify and discuss six different types of practical ecological inference using CAR and SAR models, including: (1) model selection, (2) spatial regression, (3) estimation of autocorrelation, (4) estimation of other connectivity parameters, (5) spatial prediction, and (6) spatial smoothing. We compare CAR and SAR models, showing their development and connection to partial correlations. Special cases, such as the intrinsic autoregressive model (IAR), are described. Conditional autoregressive and SAR models depend on weight matrices, whose practical development uses neighborhood definition and row-standardization. Weight matrices can also include ecological covariates and connectivity structures, which we emphasize, but have been rarely used. Trends in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in southeastern Alaska from 463 polygons, some with missing data, are used to illustrate the six inference types. We develop a variety of weight matrices and CAR and SAR spatial regression models are fit using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Profile likelihood graphs illustrate inference for covariance parameters. The same data set is used for both prediction and smoothing, and the relative merits of each are discussed. We show the nonstationary variances and correlations of a CAR model and demonstrate the effect of row-standardization. We include several take-home messages for CAR and SAR models, including (1) choosing between CAR and IAR models, (2) modeling ecological effects in the covariance matrix, (3) the appeal of spatial smoothing, and (4) how to handle isolated neighbors. We highlight several reasons why ecologists will want to make use of autoregressive models, both directly and in hierarchical models, and not only in explicit spatial settings, but also for more general connectivity models.},

  abstract = {Modeling spatial interactions that arise in spatially referenced data is commonly done by incorporating the spatial dependence into the covariance structure either explicitly or implicitly via an autoregressive model. In the case of lattice (regional summary) data, two common autoregressive models used are the conditional autoregressive model (CAR) and the simultaneously autoregressive model (SAR). Both of these models produce spatial dependence in the covariance structure as a function of a neighbor matrix W and often a \"yxed unknown spatial correlation parameter. This paper examines in detail the correlation structures implied by these models as applied to an irregular lattice in an attempt to demonstrate their many counterintuitive or impractical results. A data example is used for illustration where US statewide average SAT verbal scores are modeled and examined for spatial structure using di erent spatial models.},

This population has been hunted for subsistence for centuries by Inuit who now live in the community of Pangnirtung, Nunavut, Canada, and was harvested commercially from 1860 until 1966. The commercial harvest removed at least 10 000 individuals from the population. Visual and photographic aerial surveys were flown during August 2014 and 2017 and produced beluga whale abundance estimates of 1151 (CV = 0.214; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 760\textendash 1744) and 1381 (CV = 0.043; CI = 1270\textendash 1502), respectively. Long-term trends in abundance were examined by fitting a Bayesian surplus-production population model to a time series of abundance estimates (n = 5), flown between 1990 and 2017, taking into account reported subsistence harvests (1960\textendash 2017). The model suggests the population is declining. Engaged co-management of the Cumberland Sound beluga population and information on demographic parameters, such as reproductive rates, and age and sex composition of the harvest, are needed to restore the ecological integrity of the Cumberland Sound marine ecosystem.},

The method was tested in the field against cue counting on Iceland in 2003 and found to be an efficient method for minke whale surveys. The total block area of the survey was 290 thousand km2, with 3.7\% of the area covered by images taken at sea state three or less. Sightings include two minke whales, three humpback whales, seven fin whales, and 1366 harp seals. Uncorrected estimates of animals at the surface are 46 (CV:0.74) minke whales, 100 (CV: 0.64) humpback whales, 250 (CV: 0.48) fin whales, and 33,000 (CV: 0.22) harp seals. Correcting the minke whale estimate for whales missed by observers and for animals not at the surface gives an estimate of 510 (CV: 0.75) whales, which is significantly smaller than a revised estimate of 6,390 (CV: 0.41) whales in 1993 (Larsen, 1995; Hedley et al., 1997). Correcting the fin whale estimate for animals not at the surface gives an estimate of 980 (CV: 0.48) whales, which is similar to an estimate of 1,100 (95\% CI: 520 - 2, 100) whales in 1987-88 (IWC, 1992). A rough correction of the humpback estimate for animals not at the surface suggests an abundance of approximately 400 whales, which is similar to a mark-recapture estimate of 359 (CV: 0.08) animals for 1988-1993 (Larsen \& Hammond, 2004).},

The study involved 2 aircraft with the photo plane at 1,700 feet flying above the cue\textendash counting plane at 750 feet. The observer\textendash based distance estimates were calculated from head angles estimated by angle-boards and declination angles estimated by declinometers. These distances were checked against image\textendash based estimates of the perpendicular distance to the same whale. The 2 independent distance estimates were obtained for 21 sightings of minke whale, and there was a good agreement between the 2 types of estimates. The relative absolute deviations between the 2 estimates were on average 23\% (se: 6\%), with the errors in the observer\textendash based distance estimates resembling that of a log-normal distribution. The linear regression of the observer\textendash based estimates (obs) on the image\textendash based estimates (img) was Obs=1.1Img (R2=0.85) with an intercept fixed at zero. There was no evidence of a distance estimation bias that could generate a positive bias in the absolute abundance estimated by cue\textendash counting.},

  abstract = {Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) have been popularized by the work of Hastie and Tibshirani (1990) and the availability of user friendly GAM software in Splus. However, whilst it is flexible and efficient, the GAM framework based on backfitting with linear smoothers presents some difficulties when it comes to model selection and inference. On the other hand, the mathematically elegant work of Wahba (1990) and co-workers on Generalized Spline Smoothing (GSS) provides a rigorous framework for model selection (Gu and Wahba, 1991) and inference with GAMs constructed from smoothing splines: but unfortunately these models are computationally very expensive with operations counts that are of cubic order in the number of data. A ``middle way'' between these approaches is to construct GAMs using penalized regression splines (see e.g. Wahba 1980, 1990; Eilers and Marx 1998, Wood 2000). In this paper we develop this idea and show how GAMs constructed using penalized regression splines can be used to get most of the practical benefits of GSS models, including well founded model selection and multi-dimensional smooth terms, with the ease of use and low computational cost of backfit GAMs. Inference with the resulting methods also requires slightly fewer approximations than are employed in the GAM modelling software provided in Splus. This paper presents the basic mathematical and numerical approach to GAMs implemented in the R package mgcv, and includes two environmental examples using the methods as implemented in the package.},

In particular: (i) we generalize the original method to the case of penalties that are linear in several smoothing parameters, thereby covering the important cases of tensor product and adaptive smoothers; (ii) we show why the method's steps increase the restricted marginal likelihood of the model, that it tends to converge faster than the EM algorithm, or obvious accelerations of this, and investigate its relation to Newton optimization; (iii) we generalize the method to any Fisher regular likelihood. The method represents a considerable simplification over existing methods of estimating smoothing parameters in the context of regular likelihoods, without sacrificing generality: for example, it is only necessary to compute with the same first and second derivatives of the log-likelihood required for coefficient estimation, and not with the third or fourth order derivatives required by alternative approaches. Examples are provided which would have been impossible or impractical with pre-existing Fellner-Schall methods, along with an example of a Tweedie location, scale and shape model which would be a challenge for alternative methods, and a sparse additive modeling example where the method facilitates computational efficiency gains of several orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {The P-splines of Eilers and Marx (1996) combine a B-spline basis with a discrete quadratic penalty on the basis coefficients, to produce a reduced rank spline like smoother. P-splines have three properties that make them very popular as reduced rank smoothers: i) the basis and the penalty are sparse, enabling efficient computation, especially for Bayesian stochastic simulation; ii) it is possible to flexibly `mix-and-match' the order of B-spline basis and penalty, rather than the order of penalty controlling the order of the basis as in spline smoothing; iii) it is very easy to set up the Bspline basis functions and penalties. The discrete penalties are somewhat less interpretable in terms of function shape than the traditional derivative based spline penalties, but tend towards penalties proportional to traditional spline penalties in the limit of large basis size. However part of the point of P-splines is not to use a large basis size. In addition the spline basis functions arise from solving functional optimization problems involving derivative based penalties, so moving to discrete penalties for smoothing may not always be desirable. The purpose of this note is to point out that the three properties of basis-penalty sparsity, mix-and-match penalization and ease of setup are readily obtainable with B-splines subject to derivative based penalization. The penalty setup typically requires a few lines of code, rather than the two lines typically required for P-splines, but this one off disadvantage seems to be the only one associated with using derivative based penalties. As an example application, it is shown how basis-penalty sparsity enables efficient computation with tensor product smoothers of scattered data.},

The latter enables us to fix a well known problem with AIC for such models, thereby improving the range of model selection tools available. The smooth functions are represented by reduced rank spline like smoothers, with associated quadratic penalties measuring function smoothness. Model estimation is by penalized likelihood maximization, where the smoothing parameters controlling the extent of penalization are estimated by Laplace approximate marginal likelihood. The methods cover, for example, generalized additive models for nonexponential family responses (e.g., beta, ordered categorical, scaled t distribution, negative binomial and Tweedie distributions), generalized additive models for location scale and shape (e.g., two stage zero inflation models, and Gaussian location-scale models), Cox proportional hazards models and multivariate additive models. The framework reduces the implementation of new model classes to the coding of some standard derivatives of the log-likelihood. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {Conventional smoothing methods sometimes perform badly when used to smooth data over complex domains, by smoothing inappropriately across boundary features, such as peninsulas. Solutions to this smoothing problem tend to be computationally complex, and not to provide model smooth functions which are appropriate for incorporating as components of other models, such as generalized additive models, or mixed additive models. In this paper we propose a class of smoothers appropriate for smoothing over difficult regions of R2, which can be represented in terms of a low rank basis and one or two quadratic penalties. The key features of these smoothers are (i) that they do not `smooth across' boundary features; (ii) that their representation in terms of a basis and penalties allows straightforward incorporation as components of GAMs, mixed models and other non-standard models; (iii) that smoothness selection for these model components is straightforward to accomplish in a computationally efficient manner via GCV, AIC or REML, for example; (iv) that their low rank means that their use is computationally efficient.},

  abstract = {The smoothing spline is one of the most popular curve-fitting methods, partly because of empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness and partly because of its elegant mathematical formulation. However, there are two obstacles that restrict the use of the smoothing spline in practical statistical work. Firstly, it becomes computationally prohibitive for large data sets because the number of basis functions roughly equals the sample size. Secondly, its global smoothing parameter can only provide a constant amount of smoothing, which often results in poor performances when estimating inhomogeneous functions. In this work, we introduce a class of adaptive smoothing spline models that is derived by solving certain stochastic differential equations with finite element methods. The solution extends the smoothing parameter to a continuous data-driven function, which is able to capture the change of the smoothness of the underlying process. The new model is Markovian, which makes Bayesian computation fast. A simulation study and real data example are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract = {Spatial confounding, that is, collinearity between fixed effects and random effects in a spatial generalized linear mixed model, can adversely affect estimates of the fixed effects. Restricted spatial regression methods have been proposed as a remedy for spatial confounding. Such methods replace inference for the fixed effects of the original model with inference for those effects under a model in which the random effects are restricted to a subspace orthogonal to the column space of the fixed effects model matrix; thus, they ``deconfound'' the two types of effects. We prove, however, that frequentist inference for the fixed effects of a deconfounded linear model is generally inferior to that for the fixed effects of the original spatial linear model; in fact, it is even inferior to inference for the corresponding nonspatial model. We show further that deconfounding also leads to inferior predictive inferences, though its impact on prediction appears to be relatively small in practice. Based on these results, we argue that deconfounding a spatial linear model is bad statistical practice and should be avoided.},
