    <p>In addition to detailing the analysis used by Collier et al.
(2013, In Review), this example documents the use of <code>mrds</code> for avian
point count surveys and shows how density models can be incorporated with
occupancy models to develop spatially explicit density surface maps. For
those that are interested, for the distance sampling portion of our
analysis, we used both conventional distance sampling (<code>cds</code>) and
multiple covariate distance sampling (<code>mcds</code>) with uniform and
half-normal key functions.  For the mark-recapture portion of our analysis,
we tended to use covariates for distance (median bin width), observer, and
date of survey (days since 15 March 2011).</p>
<p>We combined our <code>mrds</code> density estimates via a Horvitz-Thompson styled
estimator with the resource selection function gradient developed in Farrell
et al. (2013) and estimated density on an ~3.14ha hexagonal grid across our
study area, which provided a density gradient for Fort Hood.  Because there
was considerable data manipulation needed for each analysis to structure the
data appropriately for use in <code>mrds</code>, rather than wrap each analysis in
a single function, we have provided both the Golden-cheeked warbler and
Black-capped vireo analyses in their full detail.  The primary differences
you will see will be changes to model structures and model outputs between
the two species.</p>
