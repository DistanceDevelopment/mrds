\title{Average detection function line for plotting}
\usage{
average.line(finebr, obs, model)
}
\arguments{
\item{finebr}{set of fine breaks in distance over which detection function
values are averaged and plotted}

\item{obs}{value of observer for averaging (1-2 individual observers; 3
duplicates; 4 pooled observation team)}

\item{model}{ddf model object}
}
\value{
list with 2 elements
  \tabular{ll}{\code{xgrid} \tab vector of gridded distance values\cr
  \code{values} \tab vector of average detection function values at
       the \code{xgrid} values\cr}
}
\description{
For models with covariates the detection probability for each observation
can vary. This function computes an average value for a set of distances to
plot an average line to graphically represent the fitted model in plots that
compare histograms and the scatter of individual estimated detection
probabilities. Averages are calculated over the observed covariate
combinations.
