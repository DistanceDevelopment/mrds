\description{
Mark-Recapture Analysis of Trial Observer Configuration with Full
Independence
}
\details{
The mark-recapture data derived from a trial observer distance sampling
survey can be used to derive a conditional detection function (p_1(y)) for
observer 1 based on trials (observations) from observer 2. It is a
conditional detection function because detection probability for observer 1
is based on seeing or not seeing observations made by observer 2. Thus,
p_1(y) is estimated by p_1|2(y).  If detections by the observers are
independent (full independence) then p_1(y)=p_1|2(y) for each distance y.
In fitting the detection functions the likelihood given by eq 6.12 or 6.17
in Laake and Borchers (2004) is used. That analysis does not require the
usual distance sampling assumption that perpendicular distances are
uniformly distributed based on line placement that is random relative to
animal distribution.  However, that assumption is used in computing
predicted detection probability which is averaged based on a uniform
distribution (see eq 6.13 of Laake and Borchers 2004).

For a complete description of each of the calling arguments, see
\code{\link{ddf}}.  The argument \code{model} in this function is the same
as \code{mrmodel} in \code{ddf}.  The argument \code{dataname} is the name
of the dataframe specified by the argument \code{data} in \code{ddf}. The
arguments \code{control},\code{meta.data},and \code{method} are defined the
same as in \code{ddf}.
