\title{Log-likelihood computation for distance sampling data}
\usage{
flnl(fpar, ddfobj, misc.options, fitting = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{fpar}{parameter values for detection function at which log-likelihood
should be evaluated}

\item{ddfobj}{distance sampling object}

\item{misc.options}{width-transect width (W); int.range-integration range
for observations; showit- 0 to 3 controls level of iteration output;
integral.numeric-if TRUE integral is computed numerically rather
than analytically}

\item{fitting}{"key" if only fitting key fct parameters, "adjust" if fitting
adjustment function parameters or "all" to fit both}
}
\value{
negative log-likelihood value at the parameter values specified in
  \code{fpar}
}
\description{
For a specific set of parameter values, it computes and returns the negative
log-likelihood for the distance sampling likelihood for distances that are
unbinned, binned and a mixture of both.  The function \code{flnl} is the
function minimized using \code{\link{optim}} from within
\code{\link{ddf.ds}}.
}
\details{
Most of the computation is in \code{flpt.lnl} in which the negative
log-likelihood is computed for each observation. \code{flnl} is a wrapper
that optionally outputs intermediate results and sums the individual
log-likelihood values.

\code{flnl} is the main routine that manipulates the parameters using
\code{\link{getpar}} to handle fitting of key, adjustment or all of the
parameters.  It then calls \code{flpt.lnl} to do the actual computation of
the likelihood.  The probability density function for point counts is
\code{fr} and for line transects is \code{fx}.
\code{fx}=g(x)/mu (where g(x) is the detection function); whereas,
f(r)=r*g(r)/mu where mu in both cases is the normalizing constant.  Both
functions are in source code file for \code{link{detfct}} and are called from
\code{distpdf} and the integral calculations are made with
\code{\link{integratepdf}}.
}
\note{
These are internal functions used by \code{\link{ddf.ds}} to fit
  distance sampling detection functions.  It is not intended for the user to
  invoke these functions but they are documented here for completeness.
