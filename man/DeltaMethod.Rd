\item{vcov}{variance-covariance matrix of the parameters}

\item{delta}{proportional change in parameters used to numerically estimate first derivative with central-difference formula}

\item{\dots}{any additional arguments needed by \code{fct}}
}

a list with values \item{variance}{estimated variance-covariance matrix of estimates derived by \code{fct}} \item{partial}{ matrix (or vector) of partial derivatives of \code{fct} with respect to the parameters \code{par}}
}
\description{
Computes delta method variance-covariance matrix of results of any generic function \code{fct} that computes a vector of estimates as a function of a set of estimated parameters \code{par}.
}
\details{
The delta method (aka propogation of errors is based on Taylor series approximation - see Seber's book on Estimation of Animal Abundance). It uses the first derivative of \code{fct} with respect to \code{par} which is computed in this function numerically using the central-difference formula. It also uses the variance-covariance matrix of the estimated parameters which is derived in estimating the parameters and is an input argument.

The first argument of \code{fct} should be \code{par} which is a vector of parameter estimates. It should return a single value (or vector) of estimate(s).  The remaining arguments of \code{fct} if any can be passed to \code{fct} by including them at the end of the call to \code{DeltaMethod} as \code{name=value} pairs.
}
\note{
This is a generic function that can be used in any setting beyond the \code{mrds} package. However this is an internal function for \code{mrds} and the user does not need to call it explicitly.
