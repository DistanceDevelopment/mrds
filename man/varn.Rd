\title{Compute empirical variance of encounter rate}
\usage{
varn(lvec,nvec,type)

         covn(lvec, groups1, groups2, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{lvec}{vector of sample measurements (e.g., line lengths)}

\item{nvec}{vector of number observed}

\item{type}{choice of variance estimator to use for encounter rate}

\item{groups1}{vector of number of groups observed}

\item{groups2}{vector of number of individuals observed}
}
\value{
Variance of encounter rate as defined by arguments
}
\description{
Computes one of a series of possible variance estimates for the observed
encounter rate for a set of sample measurements (e.g., line lengths) and
number of observations per sample.
}
\details{
The choice of type follows the notation of Fewster et al. (2009) in that
there are 8 choices of encounter rate variance that can be computed:

\describe{
\item{\code{R2}}{random line placement with unequal line lengths (design-assisted estimator)}
\item{\code{R3}}{random line placement, model-assisted estimator, based on true contagion process}
\item{\code{R4}}{random line placement, model-assisted estimator, based on apparent contagion process}
\item{\code{S1}}{systematic line placement, post-stratification with no strata overlap}
\item{\code{S2}}{systematic line placement, post-stratification with no strata overlap, variances weighted by line length per stratum}
\item{\code{O1}}{systematic line placement, post-stratification with overlapping strata (akin to S1)}
\item{\code{O2}}{systematic line placement, post-stratification with overlapping strata (weighted by line length per stratum, akin to S2)}
\item{\code{O3}}{systematic line placement, post-stratification with overlapping strata, model-assisted estimator with trend in encounter rate with line length}}

Default value is R2, shown in Fewster et al. (2009) to have good performance
for completely random designs.  For systematic parallel line transect
designs, Fewster et al. recommend O2.

For the systematic estimators, pairs are assigned in the order they are
given in the \code{lengths} and \code{groups} vectors.

\note{
This function is also used with different calling arguments to compute
  Innes et al variance of the estimated abundances/length rather than
  observation encounter rate. The function covn is probably only valid for
  R3 and R2.  Currently, the R2 form is used for all types other than R3.
