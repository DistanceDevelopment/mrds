\description{
Mark-Recapture Distance Sampling (MRDS) Analysis of Removal Observer
Configuration with Full Independence
}
\details{
The mark-recapture data derived from an removal observer distance sampling
survey can only derive conditional detection functions (p_j(y)) for both
observers (j=1) because technically it assumes that detection probability
does not vary by occasion (observer in this case).  It is a conditional
detection function because detection probability for observer 1 is
conditional on the observations seen by either of the observers. Thus,
p_1(y) is estimated by p_1|2(y).

If detections by the observers are
independent (full independence) then p_1(y)=p_1|2(y) and for the union, full
independence means that p(y)=p_1(y) + p_2(y) - p_1(y)*p_2(y) for each
distance y.  In fitting the detection functions the likelihood from Laake
and Borchers (2004) are used. That analysis does not require the usual
distance sampling assumption that perpendicular distances are uniformly
distributed based on line placement that is random relative to animal
distribution.  However, that assumption is used in computing predicted
detection probability which is averaged based on a uniform distribution (see
eq 6.11 of Laake and Borchers 2004).

For a complete description of each of the calling arguments, see
\code{\link{ddf}}.  The argument \code{model} in this function is the same
as \code{mrmodel} in \code{ddf}.  The argument \code{dataname} is the name
of the dataframe specified by the argument \code{data} in \code{ddf}. The
arguments \code{control},\code{meta.data},and \code{method} are defined the
same as in \code{ddf}.
