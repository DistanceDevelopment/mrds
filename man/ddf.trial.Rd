\description{
Mark-Recapture Distance Sampling (MRDS) Analysis of Trial Observer
Configuration and Point Independence
}
\details{
MRDS analysis based on point independence involves two separate and
independent analyses of the mark-recapture data and the distance sampling
data.  For the trial configuration, the mark-recapture data are analysed
with a call to \code{\link{ddf.trial.fi}} (see likelihood eq 6.12 and 6.17
in Laake and Borchers 2004) to fit a conditional distance sampling detection
function for observer 1 based on trials (observations) from observer 2 to
estimate p_1(0), detection probability at distance zero for observer 1.
Independently, the distance data from observer 1 are used to fit a
conventional distance sampling (CDS) (likelihood eq 6.6) or multi-covariate
distance sampling (MCDS) (likelihood eq 6.14) model for the detection
function, g(y), such that g(0)=1.  The detection function for observer 1 is
then created as p_1(y)=p_1(0)*g(y) (eq 6.28 of Laake and Borchers 2004) from
which predictions are made. \code{ddf.trial} is not called directly by the
user and is called from \code{\link{ddf}} with \code{method="trial"}.

For a complete description of each of the calling arguments, see
\code{\link{ddf}}.  The argument \code{dataname} is the name of the
dataframe specified by the argument \code{data} in \code{ddf}. The arguments
\code{dsmodel}, \code{mrmodel}, \code{control} and \code{meta.data} are
defined the same as in \code{ddf}.
