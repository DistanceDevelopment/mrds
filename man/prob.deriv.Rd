\title{Derivatives for variance of average p and average p(0) variance}
\usage{
prob.deriv(par, model, parfct, observer = NULL, fittedmodel = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{par}{detection function parameter values}

\item{model}{ddf model object}

\item{parfct}{function of detection probabilities; currently only
average (over covariates) detection probability p integrated over distance
or average (over covariates) detection probability at distance 0; p(0)}

\item{observer}{1,2,3 for primary, secondary, or duplicates for average
p(0); passed to fct}

\item{fittedmodel}{full fitted ddf model when \code{trial.fi} or
\code{io.fi} is called from \code{trial} or \code{io} respectively}
}
\value{
Vector of values from fct at specified parameter values
}
\description{
Used in call to DeltaMethod from prob.se to get first derivatives
}
\details{
Need to add equations here as I do not think they exist in any of the texts.
These should probably be checked with simulation.
