\title{Create a model frame for ddf fitting}
\usage{
create.model.frame(xmat, scale.formula, meta.data, shape.formula = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{xmat}{dataframe for ddf}

\item{scale.formula}{user specified formula for scale of distance detection
function}

\item{meta.data}{user-specified meta.data (see \code{\link{ddf}}}

\item{shape.formula}{user specified formula for shape parameter of distance
detection function}
}
\value{
model frame for analysis
}
\description{
Creates a model.frame for distance detection function fitting. It includes
some pre-specified and computed variables with those included in the model
specified by user (formula)
}
\details{
The following fields are always included: detected, observer, binned, and
optionally distance (unless null), timesdetected (if present in data). If
the distance data were binned, include distbegin and distend point fields.
If the integration width varies also include int.begin and int.end and
include an offset field for an iterative glm, if used.  Beyond these fields
only fields used in the model formula are included.
}
\note{
Internal function and not called by user
