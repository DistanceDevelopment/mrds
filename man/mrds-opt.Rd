\title{Tips on optimisation issues in \code{mrds} models}
\description{
Occasionally when fitting an `mrds` model one can run into optimisation issues. In general such problems can be quite complex so these "quick fixes" may not work. If you come up against problems that are not fixed by these tips, or you feel the results are dubious please go ahead and contact the package authors.

\section{Debug mode}{

One can obtain debug output at each stage of the optimisation using the \code{showit} option. This is set via \code{control}, so adding \code{control=list(showit=3)} gives the highest level of debug output (setting \code{showit} to 1 or 2 gives less output).
}

\section{Re-scaling covariates}{

Sometimes convergence issues in covariate (MCDS) models are caused by values of the covariate being very large, so a rescaling of that covariate is then necessary. Simply scaling by the standard deviation of the covariate can help (e.g. \code{dat$size.scaled <- dat$scale/sd(dat$scale)} for a covariate \code{size}, then including \code{size.scaled} in the model instead of \code{size}).

It is important to note that one needs to use the original covariate (size) when computing Horvitz-Thompson estimates of population size if the group size is used in that estimate. i.e. use the unscaled size in the numerator of the H-T estimator.

\section{Initial values}{

Initial (or starting) values can be set via the \code{initial} element of the \code{control} list. \code{initial} is a list itself with elements \code{scale}, \code{shape} and \code{adjustment}, corresponding to the associated parameters. If a model has covariates then the \code{scale} or \code{shape} elements will be vectors with parameter initial values in the same order as they are specific in the model formula (using \code{showit} is a good check they are in the correct order). Adjustment starting values are in order of the order of that term (cosine order 2 is before cosine order 3 terms).

One way of obtaining starting values is to fit a simpler model first (say with fewer covariates or adjustments) and then use the starting values from this simpler model for the corresponding parameters.

Another alternative to obtain starting values is to fit the model (or some submodel) using Distance for Windows. Note that Distance reports the scale parameter (or intercept in a covariate model) on the exponential sclale, so one must \code{log} this before supplying it to \code{ddf}.
}

\section{Bounds}{

One can change the upper and lower bounds for the parameters. These specify the largest and smallest values individual parameters can be. By placing these constraints on the parameters, it is possible to "temper" the optimisation problem, making fitting possible.

Again, one uses the \code{control} list, the elements \code{upperbounds} and \code{lowerbounds}. In this case, each of \code{upperbounds} and \code{lowerbounds} are vectors, which one can think of as each of the vectors \code{scale}, \code{shape} and \code{adjustment} from the "Initial values" section above, concatenated in that order. If one does not occur (e.g. no shape parameter) then it is simple omitted from the vector.
