\title{Creates design matrix for covariates in detection function}
\usage{
setcov(dmat, model)
}
\arguments{
\item{dmat}{data matrix}

\item{model}{model formula}
}
\value{
a design matrix for the specified data and model
}
\description{
This function creates a design matrix for the g(0) or scale covariates using
the input model formula. It returns a list which contains 2 elements: 1)
dim: the dimension (number of columns) of the design matrix, and 2) cov: the
constructed design matrix. This function is relatively simple because it
uses the built-in function \code{\link{model.matrix}} which does the
majority of the work.  This function handles 2 exceptions "~.", the null
model with 0 columns and "~1" the intercept only model - a column of 1s.  If
a model other than the 2 exceptions is provided, it calls
\code{\link{model.matrix}} to construct the columns. If any of the colums of
the design matrix are all 0's the column is removed.  This occurs when there
is no data for a particular factor.
