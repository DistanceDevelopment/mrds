\title{Logistic detection function}
\usage{
logisticdetfct(distance, theta, w, std = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance}{perpendicular distance vector}

\item{theta}{scale parameters}

\item{w}{scale covariate matrix}

\item{std}{if TRUE uses scale=1

The routine returns a vector of probabilities that the observation
were detected given they were at the specified distance and assuming that
g(0)=1 (ie a standard line transect detection function).}
