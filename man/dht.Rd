\description{
Computes density and abundance estimates and variances based on
Horvitz-Thompson-like estimator
}
\details{
Density and abundance within the sampled region is computed based on a
Horvitz-Thomspon-like estimator for groups and individuals (if a clustered
population) and this is extrapolated to the entire survey region based on
any defined regional stratification.  The variance is based on replicate
samples within any regional stratification.  For clustered populations, E(s)
and its standard error are also output.

Abundance is estimated with a Horvitz-Thompson-like estimator (Huggins
1989,1991; Borchers et al 1998; Borchers and Burnham 2004).  The abundance
in the sampled region is simply 1/p_1 + 1/p_2 + ... + 1/p_n where p_i is the
estimated detection probability for the ith detection of n total
observations. It is not strictly a Horvitz-Thompson estimator because the
p_i are estimated and not known. For animals observed in tight clusters,
that estimator gives the abundance of groups (\code{group=TRUE} in
\code{options}) and the abundance of individuals is estimated as s_1/p_1 +
s_2/p_2 + ... + s_n/p_n, where s_i is the size (e.g., number of animals in
the group) of each observation(\code{group=FALSE} in \code{options}).

Extrapolation and estimation of abundance to the entire survey region is
based on either a random sampling design or a stratified random sampling
design.  Replicate samples(lines)(\code{sample.table} are specified within
regional strata \code{region.table}, if any.  If there is no stratification,
\code{region.table} should contain only a single record with the \code{Area}
for the entire survey region.  The \code{sample.table} is linked to the
\code{region.table} with the \code{Region.Label}.  The \code{obs.table} is
linked to the \code{sample.table} with the \code{Sample.Label} and
\code{Region.Label}.  Abundance can be restricted to a subset (e.g., for a
particular species) of the population by limiting the list the observations
in \code{obs.table} to those in the desired subset. Alternatively, if
\code{Sample.Label} and \code{Region.Label} are in the dataframe used to fit
the model, then a \code{subset} argument can be given in place of the
\code{obs.table}. To use the \code{subset} argument but include all of the
observations, use \code{subset=1==1} to avoid creating an \code{obs.table}.

In extrapolating to the entire survey region it is important that the unit
measurements be consistent or converted for consistency.  A conversion
factor can be specified with the \code{convert.units} variable in the
\code{options} list.  The values of \code{Area} in \code{region.table}, must
be made consistent with the units for \code{Effort} in \code{sample.table}
and the units of \code{distance} in the dataframe that was analyzed.  It is
easiest to do if the units of \code{Area} is the square of the units of
\code{Effort} and then it is only necessary to convert the units of
\code{distance} to the units of \code{Effort}. For example, if \code{Effort}
was entered in kilometers and \code{Area} in square kilometers and
\code{distance} in meters then using
\code{options=list(convert.units=0.001)} would convert meters to kilometers,
density would be expressed in square kilometers which would then be
consistent with units for \code{Area}.  However, they can all be in
different units as long as the appropriate composite value for
\code{convert.units} is chosen.  Abundance for a survey region can be
expressed as: \code{A*N/a} where \code{A} is \code{Area} for the survey
region, \code{N} is the abundance in the covered (sampled) region, and
\code{a} is the area of the sampled region and is in units of \code{Effort *
distance}.  The sampled region \code{a} is multiplied by
\code{convert.units}, so it should be chosen such that the result is in the
same units of \code{Area}.  For example, if \code{Effort} was entered in
kilometers, \code{Area} in hectares (100m x 100m) and \code{distance} in
meters, then using \code{options=list(convert.units=10)} will convert
\code{a} to units of hectares (100 to convert meters to 100 meters for
distance and .1 to convert km to 100m units).

If the argument \code{se} is set to \code{TRUE}, a standard error for
density and abundance is computed and the coefficient of variation and
log-normal confidence intervals are constructed using a Satterthwaite
approximation for degrees of freedom (Buckland et al. 2001 pg 90).  The
function \code{\link{dht.se}} computes the variance and interval estimates.
The variance has two components: 1) variation due to uncertanity from
estimation of the detection function and 2) variation in abundance due to
random sample selection.  The first component is computed using a delta
method estimate of variance (\code{\link{DeltaMethod}} (Huggins 1989, 1991,
Borchers et al. 1998) in which the first derivatives of the abundance
estimator with respect to the parameters in the detection function are
computed numerically.  The second component can be computed in one of three
ways as set by the option \code{varflag} with values 0,1,2. A value of 0 is
to use a binomial variance for the number of observations and it is only
useful if the sampled region is the survey region and the objects are not
clustered which will not occur very often.  A value of 1 uses the standard
variance for the encounter rate (Buckland et al. 2001 pg 78-79, although the
actual encounter rate formula used by default is now estimator R2 from
Fewster et al. (2009) - see \link{varn} for details).  If the population is
clustered the mean group size and standard error is also included.  This
variance estimator is not appropriate if \code{size} or a derivative of
\code{size} is used in the any of the detection function models. In general
if any covariates are used in the models, the default option 2 is
preferable.  It uses the variance estimator suggested by Innes et al (2002)
which used the formula for the variance ecounter rate but replaces the
number of observations per sample with the estimated abundance per sample.
This latter variance is also given in Marques and Buckland (2004).

The argument \code{options} is a list of variable=value pairs that set
options for the analysis. All but one of these has been described so far.
The remaining variable \code{pdelta} should not need to be changed but was
included for completeness.  It controls the precision of the first
derivative calculation for the delta method variance.
