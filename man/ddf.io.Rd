\description{
Mark-Recapture Distance Sampling (MRDS) Analysis of Independent Observer
Configuration and Point Independence
}
\details{
MRDS analysis based on point independence involves two separate and
independent analyses of the mark-recapture data and the distance sampling
data.  For the independent observer configuration, the mark-recapture data
are analysed with a call to \code{\link{ddf.io.fi}} (see likelihood eq 6.8
and 6.16 in Laake and Borchers 2004) to fit conditional distance sampling
detection functions to estimate p(0), detection probability at distance zero
for the independent observer team based on independence at zero (eq 6.22 in
Laake and Borchers 2004). Independently, the distance data, the union of the
observations from the independent observers, are used to fit a conventional
distance sampling (CDS) (likelihood eq 6.6) or multi-covariate distance
sampling (MCDS) (likelihood eq 6.14) model for the detection function, g(y),
such that g(0)=1. The detection function for the observer team is then
created as p(y)=p(0)*g(y) (eq 6.28 of Laake and Borchers 2004) from which
predictions are made. \code{ddf.io} is not called directly by the user and
is called from \code{\link{ddf}} with \code{method="io"}.

For a complete description of each of the calling arguments, see
\code{\link{ddf}}.  The argument \code{dataname} is the name of the
dataframe specified by the argument \code{data} in \code{ddf}. The arguments
\code{dsmodel}, \code{mrmodel}, \code{control} and \code{meta.data} are
defined the same as in \code{ddf}.
