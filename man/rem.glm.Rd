\title{Iterative offset model fitting of mark-recapture with removal model}
\usage{
rem.glm(datavec, fitformula, eps = 1e-05, iterlimit = 500, GAM = FALSE,
  gamplot = TRUE, datavec2)
}
\arguments{
\item{datavec}{dataframe containing records seen by either observer 1 or 2}

\item{fitformula}{logit link formula}

\item{eps}{convergence criterion}

\item{iterlimit}{maximum number of iterations allowed}

\item{GAM}{uses GAM instead of GLM for fitting}

\item{gamplot}{set to TRUE to get a gam plot object if \code{GAM=TRUE}}

\item{datavec2}{dataframe containing all records for observer 1 and observer
2 as in io.glm form; this is used in case there is an observer(not
platform effect)}
}
\value{
list of class("remglm","glm","lm") or class("remglm","gam")
  \item{glmobj}{GLM or GAM object} \item{offsetvalue}{offsetvalues from
  iterative fit} \item{plotobj}{gam plot object (if GAM & gamplot==TRUE,
  else NULL)}
}
\description{
Detection function fitting from mark-recapture data with a removal
configuration in which a secondary observer knows what the primary observer
detects and detects objects missed by the primary observer.  The iterative
offset glm/gam uses an offset to compensate for the conditioning on the set
of objects seen by either observer (eg 00 those missed by both observers are
not included in the analysis.  This function is similar to
\code{\link{io.glm}}.
}
\details{
The only difference between this function and \code{\link{io.glm}} is the
offset and the data construction because there is only one detection
function being estimated for the primary observer. The two functions could
be merged.
}
\note{
currently the code in this function for GAMs has been commented out
  until the remainder of the mrds package will work with GAMs.
