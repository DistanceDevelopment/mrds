\description{
Computes standard error, cv, and log-normal confidence intervals for
abundance and density within each region (if any) and for the total of all
the regions.  It also produces the correlation matrix for regional and total
estimates.

\details{
The variance has two components: 1) variation due to uncertanity from
estimation of the detection function and 2) variation in abundance due to
random sample selection.  The first component is computed using a delta
method estimate of variance (\code{\link{DeltaMethod}} (Huggins 1989, 1991,
Borchers et al. 1998) in which the first derivatives of the abundance
estimator with respect to the parameters in the detection function are
computed numerically.  The second component can be computed in one of three
ways as set by the option \code{varflag} with values 0,1,2.

A value of 0 is to use a binomial variance for the number of observations
and it is only useful if the sampled region is the survey region and the
objects are not clustered which will not occur very often. If covered region
is less than the survey region the variance estimator is scaled up but it
will be a poor estimator and the confidence interval will likely not achieve
the nominal level.

A value of 1 uses the variance for the encounter rate of (Fewster et al.
(2009), estimator R2 (which has been shown to have better properties than
the previous default of Buckland et al. 2001 pg 78-79)).  If
\code{group=FALSE} the variance of the mean group size is also included.
This variance estimator is not appropriate if \code{size} or a derivative of
\code{size} is used in the any of the detection function models.

In general if any covariates are used in the models, the default option 2 is
preferable.  It uses a variance estimator based on that suggested by Innes
et al. (2002) which used the formula for the variance ecounter rate but
replaces the number of observations per sample with the estimated abundance
per sample.  The difference between the version used here and that in Innes
et al. (2002) is that Innes et al. use an estimator with form similar to
that of Buckland et al. (2001), while the estimator here uses a form based
on Fewster et al. (2009, estimator R2).

For more on encounter rate variance estimation, see \link{varn}.

Exceptions to the above occur if there is only one sample in a stratum. In
that case it uses Poisson assumption (var(x)=x) and it assumes a known
variance so z=1.96 is used for critical value. In all other cases the
degrees of freedom for the t-distribution assumed for the log(abundance) or
log(density) is based on the Satterthwaite approximation (Buckland et al.
2001 pg 90) for the degrees of freedom (df).  The df are weighted by the
squared cv in combining the two sources of variation because of the assumed
log-normal distribution because the components are multiplicative.  For
combining df for the sampling variance across regions they are weighted by
the variance because it is a sum across regions.

A non-zero correlation between regional estimates can occur from using a
common detection function across regions.  This is reflected in the
correlation matrix of the regional and total estimates which is given in the
value list.  It is only needed if subtotals of regional estimates are
needed.

This function is called by \code{dht} and it is not expected that the
  user will call this function directly but it is documented here for
  completeness and for anyone expanding the code or using this function in
  their own code
