\description{
Mark-Recapture Analysis of Independent Observer Configuration with Full
Independence
}
\details{
The mark-recapture data derived from an independent observer distance
sampling survey can be used to derive conditional detection functions
(p_j(y)) for both observers (j=1,2).  They are conditional detection
functions because detection probability for observer j is based on seeing or
not seeing observations made by observer 3-j. Thus, p_1(y) is estimated by
p_1|2(y).

If detections by the observers are independent (full
independence) then p_1(y)=p_1|2(y),p_2(y)=p_2|1(y) and for the union, full
independence means that p(y)=p_1(y) + p_2(y) - p_1(y)*p_2(y) for each
distance y.  In fitting the detection functions the likelihood given by eq
6.8 and 6.16 in Laake and Borchers (2004) is used. That analysis does not
require the usual distance sampling assumption that perpendicular distances
are uniformly distributed based on line placement that is random relative to
animal distribution.  However, that assumption is used in computing
predicted detection probability which is averaged based on a uniform
distribution (see eq 6.11 of Laake and Borchers 2004).

For a complete description of each of the calling arguments, see
\code{\link{ddf}}.  The argument \code{model} in this function is the same
as \code{mrmodel} in \code{ddf}.  The argument \code{dataname} is the name
of the dataframe specified by the argument \code{data} in \code{ddf}. The
arguments \code{control},\code{meta.data},and \code{method} are defined the
same as in \code{ddf}.
