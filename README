mrds - Mark-Recapture Distance Sampling

This package for R analyzes single or double observer distance sampling data for line or point sampling.  It is used in program DISTANCE (http://www.ruwpa.st-and.ac.uk/distance/) as one of the analysis engines. Supported double observer configurations include independent, trial and removal. All options in mrds are not yet fully supported via DISTANCE. The following are references for the methods used in the package.
