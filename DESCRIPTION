Description: Animal abundance estimation via conventional, multiple covariate
    and mark-recapture distance sampling (CDS/MCDS/MRDS). Detection function
    fitting is performed via maximum likelihood. Also included are diagnostics
    and plotting for fitted detection functions. Abundance estimation is via a
    Horvitz-Thompson-like estimator.
